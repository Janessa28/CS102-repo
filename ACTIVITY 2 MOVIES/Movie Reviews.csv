"The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)","Illumination's best since Despicable Me 1.","benjaminskylerhill","Video games have long been plagued by subpar adaptions of their materials, but on their second attempt, the Mario Bros save the day. Being on par with the likes of Sonic and Detective Pikachu, this film hits all the fun beats you would want from a Mario film. Including plenty of fun moments for fans of the expansive franchise, this also stays completely understandable and entertaining for anyone who checks it out. With some interesting voice acting choices, no one took you out of the film and everyone felt like great choices for this vibrant world. Wishing that it stood out more or took on more intriguing choices, I was still walking away happy and hopeful for the future of this franchise and the possibilities to come.","5 September 2023","8/10",NA
"The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)","Solid Example of Game to Screen Adaptation","Ltufano23","Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are struggling Brooklyn brother plumbers. When the city's sewer goes haywire, Mario sees an opportunity for heroic fame. Instead, they get sucked into an alternate world. The brothers get separated. Mario joins Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) to recruit the Kong army in their fight against the evil turtle Bowser (Jack Black). Luigi gets captured.It's brightly colored. It's energetic. It's got the characters. There's the game play. The story is fairly simple. It's pretty much what I expected. I wish there is more heart to it. The brothers could have been that, but they get separated pretty quickly. I played some of the games over the years and this will probably appeal to the fans. It's got all the brightly colored chaos for the kids. It's less so for everybody else.","19 April 2023","7/10",NA
"The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)","pretty much as expected","SnoopyStyle","I think for what this movie sets out to do, Super Mario Bros. Movie pretty much ticks the boxes of an entertaining, reference fan-service heavy movie. A lot of the jokes are basic sure, but it's just impressive that there is some competency to a Video Game Movie. Sometimes simple and straightforward is the best way to go. Not high art or anything, but it ticks off almost everything for what Mario should be at least. Voice acting wasn't as bad as I thought, and Jack Black was the highlight as expected. Yeah, not gonna win any big awards but judge it for what it is, and yeah by Video Game Movie standards it's one of the best ones easily if you ask me.6.5/10.","5 April 2023","6/10",NA
"The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)","Everyone is so fixated on rotten tomatoes scores, it really is a solid film.","nickryan-44535","This is a movie that feels like a love letter to all the Nintendo fans out there, even if they don't necessarily play Mario anymore. The film delivers a fun and enjoyable experience for viewers by faithfully adapting every aspect of the game into the movie, including the Mario Kart and Donkey Kong franchises. The movie is packed with non-stop action and fast-paced storytelling, leaving little room for some of the more significant elements that fans might have wanted to see. It may not be able to fulfill every fan's wishes, but it's understandable and sets up for a sequel, as there is a post-credits scene.But for general audiences who are not familiar with Mario enough, this might be a movie that is difficult to understand. There may be questions like why does it have to be like this? Why do it this way? Why is the world so strange? This is because the story hardly explains in detail for us to know how the world is. Even though the story is simple and has nothing much. But if you don't think too much, it's an easy and enjoyable movie to watch, with the lovable characters in the style of the works from the studio that made Despicable Me.","5 April 2023","8/10",NA
"The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)","An absolute BLAST!","justinvitelli","Sometimes you come across a movie that takes no risks. It's light on story, avoids character development, and focuses on getting to the next scene as easily as possible. Mario Bros. Doesn't have any inherent plot holes or issues, but it tends to leave you in a state of just being a viewer rather than participating in the movie. In the end, it's not bad per se, but comes off as flat and lifeless.The positives are all agreed upon by anyone who likes it, because the positives stand out by not being able to be compared against anything else. People have fun with the action. They love the Easter eggs. And the composed music is good. The action is done well, but without much dramatic weight, only carry the movie so far. Easter eggs don't nor should have any bearing on how good the ovoid is. The music was well incorporated, minus the pop songs that truly don't work.It's not good enough to play things easy, and rely on fans to spot visual Easter eggs, to call the movie good. It's average at best mostly because it was watchable and didn't have any outright flaws. It just didn't take chances that could've ended up becoming flaws. Even if you had a good time watching it, there's not enough value to see it again. If you're a fan, check it out. If not, you won't miss a thing by skipping it.","5 April 2023","10/10",NA
"The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)","Critics are being too harsh for what it is","AdrenalinDragon","Took my kids for a special sky screening and boy were we excited! At first I was rather skeptical thinking this film won't do any justice to the games. However, I was wrong! This film met our expectation and beyond. I think I enjoyed this film more than my kids. From the moment the film starts it is enjoyable. Good sense of humour and a lot of nice scenes. A lot of laughable moments. Apart from the film being too short it still met my expectations. As a 39 year old who played all the Mario games since childhood, this bought back a lot of fond memories of sleepless nights of playing the Mario games. A must watch film whether you have kids or not.","5 April 2023","7/10",NA
"The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)","The Message Of Love Is Sent Directly To The Fanbase, Not To The General Audience.","folk_egm","If you only watch the movie with the intention of having fun, you will certainly have a good experience with Mario. However the plot is quite bland and the movie runs at a very fast pace between one scene and another, hampering the progress of the story.Also, if you haven't played the Mario games, you'll fail immeasurably to pick up the game references that are scattered throughout the movie, and there are many of them. For anyone who's a Mario fan, this movie is literally fan service and it's no wonder why they're giving it a 10.For me, this movie doesn't lived up to the hype, but for a Mario fan, it certainly did.","6 April 2023","7/10",NA
"The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)","Chris Pratt was awesome as Mario and Jack black as bowser was remarkable!!!!!!","gabethedinosaur","Some people are taking this movie too seriously. This movie is just supposed to be fun and colorful and not to be taken like a tarantino movie or something. Of course the plot could be improved a bit here and there but it's actually a really fun and entertaining movie when you just enjoy the ride. If you're a big fan of Mario you will absolutely love this movie 100%. I felt like a little kid again when i saw all the characters and easter eggs in every scene. The animation was insanely well done and i believe they could've made the movie a bit longer to expand on the world a bit more and get to know each character more but that's about it.","10 April 2023","10/10",NA
"The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)","Just average.","movies_are_life_","As a purely fluff piece - it's fun, bright spirited, and enjoyable for families. A movie that has all of the elements you'd want represented from Super Mario bros video games, and as a bonus, it also showcases Mario cart and donkey kong junior. The animation is strong, the worlds are exactly like the video games and truly fun moments for kids. The runtime is great and the movie moves along without pause.AND I expect better, higher quality movie making.The voice acting in this movie is so lazy. Chris Pratt is forgettable-anyone could have done better voicing such a beloved character. Princess Peach is the same - voice acting is boring and fairly emotionless. The worst voice acting belongs to Seth's terrible Donkey Kong junior - not a single attempt to make an actual character voice, just Seth's normal voice slapped on Donkey Kong. Toad's voice acting is also meatless and without any real jokes.The script is mostly empty and there is little to no attempt at character motivation, organic character decision making - for example, why Princess Peach tells Mario he can come with her to save her kingdom. Almost every opportunity to make a joke is skipped. None of the characters have stated goals aside from King Koppa.And saddest of all to me, there is no attempt to create backstory or give context to these beloved worlds and characters.","5 April 2023","5/10",NA
"The Super Mario Bros.

It's not gonna happen, it's a kids movie.When I was a kid I saw the old Hopkins-Leguizamo movie... OMG, it was horrible. I get it, we didn't have CGI back then, but an animated movie like this one would have been amazing. Waaaay better than that... garbage of a film.This new one explores all the common elements of the franchise, beautifully crafted world with attention to details. My 7 year old girl LOVED IT. I was kinda bored, but she loved it, this rating is for her, that's what's important, it's a movie for kids, they should rate it.There are a lot of man-childs on the internet criticizing it. Don't listen to them. If you have a kid who loves Mario just take them, no doubt about it. If you're a nostalgic grown up, you're not going to have a bad time, but it's not what you expect, there are like 1 or 2 ""grown up jokes"", that's it, it's not like those disney movies that have a lot of hints for grown ups, this one doesn't, it's a KIDS MOVIE as it should be.I get that grown ups need to be entertained, but it shouldn't be the rule, the most important thing is that kids love it.","8 April 2023","10/10",NA

"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","There is such a thing as too much","neil-476","Imagine a video game where you are shooting bad guys. Your hardware is old so everything is kind of slow and out of focus. The opponents are set to Easy and you installed a hack to give you invincibility and autoaim. And they come at you slowly, shouting, out in the open, with weapons that fire three or four bullets before they run out and they can shoot anything anyway. They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife. And you try to fight them in a decent manner, yet your avatar moves like a 60 year old man and even with the autoaim you still suck. And if you somehow get into the many separate levels where nothing make sense, you get a big cinematic that takes you out of it. And because the cinematic is in 4k or whatever, it feels like slow motion.That, my friends, is the experience of watching JW4. The style that people have applauded in the first movie has turned into a demented caricature, the fight scenes are ridiculously bad, the actions of the characters make no sense at all, the world described makes no sense. Not even the tongue-in-cheek references to The Matrix don't hit, because you know that if you enjoyed that film, you're now over 40 and it makes you feel old. The film is three hours of irrelevance.And if you are among the people who I can't understand that rated this film anything above boring, just watch the end credits scene. It destroys the little joy that you might have kept watching this.Bottom line: So many talented people worked on this film. With them on board, I cannot imagine a worse outcome. It's not even funny, it's just sad.","23 May 2023","5/10",NA
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","What a pointless film","siderite","These John Wick movies can be sort of fun in the sense that they are unintelligent violent nonsense pretending to be movies. There is something entertaining about dumb nonsense sometimes, and the first two of this franchise was decently okay in this regard. The last one and this one however not so much, only dumb.This movie is almost 3 hours long, and oh boy do you feel every minute. Because if you have seen the previous instalments you have seen this one to. This is like a bad video game repeating the same thing, the same course, the same enemies, and for the 4th time. There is also a post credit scene, which is simply dumb, no reason to stil around for it.The acting is also horrid, and if you are going to buy any of this you have to have good acting but no.The only positive I can say about this movie is that it is not as putrified as many other movies lately so for a contemporary action movie this is not as bad as much else.I give this a very, very generous 3/10. If you want to watch this, don't. Go watch the first one, and maybe the second one instead. Those are also highly stupid, but at least decently entertaining, this is not.","25 March 2023","4/10",NA
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","It got on my wick.","BA_Harrison","I went to the cinema with great expectations. I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous, the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated. However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. ""Parabellum"" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.","23 May 2023","4/10",NA

The storyline was very weak and after such a long gap between this and John Wick 3 I am surprised it was written better.I also have no idea why this review has to be a minimum go 600 characters?Yes we.","24 March 2023","3/10",NA

The little soul the first two had is dead and buried here. I don't get the hype. John Wick has become like those generic, action B movies with cliched scripts and characters.

Now with #4 they show that they are not artists or creatives but merely clowns looking for as buck.It's not completely without value, which is why it got a 2 instead of a 1.

"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","I don't understand the great scores of this movie","antti-eskelinen-329-929792","Most American action flicks released these days have poor screenplays and overuse computer-generated imagery. The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame.The stunts and choreography are beyond impressive. Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen's performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great, but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack, it's easy to overlook because everything else is so great.I can't fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It's so fast-paced, and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out, it's unbelievable. It's hard to explain -- you have to see it! Why watch a computer-generated ""superhero"" fly around when you can witness Reeves and Yen engage in a genuine and thrilling fight?","24 March 2023","4/10",NA
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","""Yeah.""","IMDbKeepsDeletingMyReviews","Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.There is every kind of fighting imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol/sword combo is my fave).The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic.Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME.EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.It's definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road). Every other action movie should learn from this.

Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. If you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. Yeah.","30 March 2023","2/10",NA
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","Ridiculous, boring and pathetic...","drjgardner","Stuntman turned writer/director Chad Stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit John Wick. It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.Speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Stahelski/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.","29 March 2023","2/10",NA
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","There is such a thing as too much","neil-476","Imagine a video game where you are shooting bad guys. Your hardware is old so everything is kind of slow and out of focus. The opponents are set to Easy and you installed a hack to give you invincibility and autoaim. And they come at you slowly, shouting, out in the open, with weapons that fire three or four bullets before they run out and they can shoot anything anyway. They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife. And you try to fight them in a decent manner, yet your avatar moves like a 60 year old man and even with the autoaim you still suck. And if you somehow get into the many separate levels where nothing make sense, you get a big cinematic that takes you out of it. And because the cinematic is in 4k or whatever, it feels like slow motion.That, my friends, is the experience of watching JW4. The style that people have applauded in the first movie has turned into a demented caricature, the fight scenes are ridiculously bad, the actions of the characters make no sense at all, the world described makes no sense. Not even the tongue-in-cheek references to The Matrix don't hit, because you know that if you enjoyed that film, you're now over 40 and it makes you feel old. The film is three hours of irrelevance.And if you are among the people who I can't understand that rated this film anything above boring, just watch the end credits scene. It destroys the little joy that you might have kept watching this.Bottom line: So many talented people worked on this film. With them on board, I cannot imagine a worse outcome. It's not even funny, it's just sad.","23 May 2023","5/10",NA
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","What a pointless film","siderite","These John Wick movies can be sort of fun in the sense that they are unintelligent violent nonsense pretending to be movies. There is something entertaining about dumb nonsense sometimes, and the first two of this franchise was decently okay in this regard. The last one and this one however not so much, only dumb.This movie is almost 3 hours long, and oh boy do you feel every minute. Because if you have seen the previous instalments you have seen this one to. This is like a bad video game repeating the same thing, the same course, the same enemies, and for the 4th time. There is also a post credit scene, which is simply dumb, no reason to stil around for it.The acting is also horrid, and if you are going to buy any of this you have to have good acting but no.The only positive I can say about this movie is that it is not as putrified as many other movies lately so for a contemporary action movie this is not as bad as much else.I give this a very, very generous 3/10. If you want to watch this, don't. Go watch the first one, and maybe the second one instead. Those are also highly stupid, but at least decently entertaining, this is not.","25 March 2023","4/10",NA
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","It got on my wick.","BA_Harrison","I went to the cinema with great expectations. I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous, the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated. However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. ""Parabellum"" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.","23 May 2023","4/10",NA

The storyline was very weak and after such a long gap between this and John Wick 3 I am surprised it was written better.I also have no idea why this review has to be a minimum go 600 characters?Yes we.","24 March 2023","3/10",NA

Thought #2 was OK. Then came #3., It showed they were out of imagination and should have stopped with #2. Now with #4 they show that they are not artists or creatives but merely clowns looking for as buck.It's not completely without value, which is why it got a 2 instead of a 1.

"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","I don't understand the great scores of this movie","antti-eskelinen-329-929792","Most American action flicks released these days have poor screenplays and overuse computer-generated imagery. The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame.The stunts and choreography are beyond impressive. Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen's performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great, but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack, it's easy to overlook because everything else is so great.I can't fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It's so fast-paced, and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out, it's unbelievable. It's hard to explain -- you have to see it! Why watch a computer-generated ""superhero"" fly around when you can witness Reeves and Yen engage in a genuine and thrilling fight?","24 March 2023","4/10",NA
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","""Yeah.""","IMDbKeepsDeletingMyReviews","Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.There is every kind of fighting imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol/sword combo is my fave).The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic.Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME.EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.It's definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road). Every other action movie should learn from this.

"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","What a pointless film","siderite","These John Wick movies can be sort of fun in the sense that they are unintelligent violent nonsense pretending to be movies. There is something entertaining about dumb nonsense sometimes, and the first two of this franchise was decently okay in this regard. The last one and this one however not so much, only dumb.This movie is almost 3 hours long, and oh boy do you feel every minute. Because if you have seen the previous instalments you have seen this one to. This is like a bad video game repeating the same thing, the same course, the same enemies, and for the 4th time. There is also a post credit scene, which is simply dumb, no reason to stil around for it.The acting is also horrid, and if you are going to buy any of this you have to have good acting but no.The only positive I can say about this movie is that it is not as putrified as many other movies lately so for a contemporary action movie this is not as bad as much else.I give this a very, very generous 3/10. If you want to watch this, don't. Go watch the first one, and maybe the second one instead. Those are also highly stupid, but at least decently entertaining, this is not.","25 March 2023","4/10",NA
"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)","It got on my wick.","BA_Harrison","I went to the cinema with great expectations. I have to admit that the photography is gorgeous, the locations are wonderful and the action sequences are well coordinated. However I feel that the true identity of this franchise was completely lost with this fourth chapter. The first two movies for me are the best because the stunts look more credible. ""Parabellum"" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. Here John suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. When Chad Stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. Now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a TV show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. This got definitely out of hand and Wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. In my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. I really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.","23 May 2023","4/10",NA

Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame.The stunts and choreography are beyond impressive. Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen's performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great, but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack, it's easy to overlook because everything else is so great.I can't fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It's so fast-paced, and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out, it's unbelievable. It's hard to explain -- you have to see it!

There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.There is every kind of fighting imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol/sword combo is my fave).The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic.Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME.EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.It's definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road). Every other action movie should learn from this.

Even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. This franchise has set new standards. If anybody says a movie is good like John Wick, it better f'n be! The set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. The Tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. The only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people.

Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.Speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Stahelski/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general .

Your hardware is old so everything is kind of slow and out of focus. The opponents are set to Easy and you installed a hack to give you invincibility and autoaim. And they come at you slowly, shouting, out in the open, with weapons that fire three or four bullets before they run out and they can shoot anything anyway. They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife. And you try to fight them in a decent manner, yet your avatar moves like a 60 year old man and even with the autoaim you still suck. And if you somehow get into the many separate levels where nothing make sense, you get a big cinematic that takes you out of it.

"No One Will Save You (2023","What I think happened...","maxglen","PlotAn exiled anxiety-ridden homebody must battle an alien who's found its way into her home.CastWriter/Director Brian Duffield has been involved with several films I really enjoyed such as Love & Monsters, Spontaneous and The Babysitter so I'm saddened I couldn't hold this to the same level. Beyond that I knew nobody, I have to credit leading lady Kaitlyn Dever though she was great here.VerdictI'm not a sci-fi guy, immediately I was concerned I wouldn't like this but advertised as a sci-fi horror I thought I'd give it a go.What you notice first is how well made it is, fantastic cinematography, a fascinating character with a hidden background you're looking forward to finding out about and manages to pad out her universe really quite wellWhen everything kicks off it looks great and is paced perfectly, despise my initial concerns I was gripped. The trouble is such sequences get repetitious, basically the same thing happens each time and never really changes things up. Furthermore when you learn about our characters plight it's not really very engaging and has been done before.Though the movie looks great, the leading lady is competent and there's unexpected depth to the film it still fell short for me and delivered a highly average effort.RantsTo show how little interest I have in sci-fi look at this, X-Files was always a show that I wanted to like but I found myself struggling as episodes always came under one of two headings. 1) The ongoing plot which which featured conspiracies, the smoking man, Mulders sister, ufo's, aliens etc and then 2) The standalone episodes, these featured a creature or person with a mysterious power. I enjoyed the latter episodes, I despised the former.BreakdownLooks great
Some solid moments
Surprising depth
Decent lead
Some moments get old
Not keen on the finale
Some bits are very lackluster.","21 February 2024","8/10",NA
"No One Will Save You (2023","No One Will Save You: Looks the part but goes nowhere","Platypuschow","In the small town of Mill River, Brynn Adams (Kaitlyn Dever) lives on the edge of town in her isolated home only occasionally venturing into town as she's not welcome due to an incident involving her former best friend Maude Collins. During the night, Brynn is awoken by strange noises from in her home that soon prove to be unearthly in nature and a prelude of a bigger nightmare to come.No One Will Save You is the sophomore feature of Brian Duffield following his 2020 debut Spontaneous. The script was acquired by 20th Century Fox in a competitive bidding war and featured up and coming actress Kaitlyn Dever attached as the lead who'd earned strong acclaim in miniseries such as Unbelievable and Dopesick as well as the 2019 film Booksmart. Largely shot under the radar on a modest budget (roughly $23 million), the movie now makes a rather lowkey debut on Hulu and while it is overall good, I'll admit I did find myself less engaged in the third act.One of the major defining features of No One Will Save You is that with the exception of one line, the film has no spoken dialogue and this is a purely visual film in terms of creating story and characterization. Kaitlyn Dever has proven herself time and time again as a reliable actress and that's no less true here as she takes what's essentially a one woman show for much of the time and must create a character purely through facial expressions and pantomime and it really works as you get an idea for her character and the situation in her town without a word being spoken. Once the aliens show up, the movie puts its minimalist setting to good use and despite the aliens being somewhat conventional in nature, Duffield finds unique ways of using them (and to a degree justifying their appearance) and we get some really memorable sequences of Brynn either hiding from the aliens or being chased by them. I do have some misgivings about the film especially in how it maybe stretches itself a little much in its minimalist dialogue with a scene towards the middle of the film where Brynn doesn't file a police report (which they try to justify to mixed results in my opinion). The movie also has a third act that tries to tie back to the incident with Brynn's friend Maude and while I think it is better handled than how Signs handled similar traumatic incidents in its take on aliens, it didn't quite hit the mark for me especially with the rather strange note the movie ends on.It's honestly a shame this movie's been released on Hulu instead of in theaters, because I can see this being exactly the kind of low budget high concept genre film that's begging to be experienced with a full auditorium that would see it perform in the company of films such as Super 8 and A Quiet Place. While I have my personal misgivings about the end result, I applaud Duffield for trying to do something out of convention with the alien sci-fi genre and Dever continues to show what a strong actress she is. That alone makes it worth a viewing in my opinion.","22 September 2023","5/10",NA
"No One Will Save You (2023","Brian Duffield delivers an engaging alien invasion thriller with a strong performance by Kaitlyn Dever, even with a messy third act","IonicBreezeMachine","I am always interested in people doing something new and this film certainly does that. It already felt different when the premise was a home invasion with aliens. However, it also has minimal dialogue with maybe 5 whole dialogue throughout the whole 90 minutes.Massive props to the lead actress, Kaitlyn Dever, as the main character Brynn. She has the job of conveying the emotions of her character solely by facial and body language which she succeeds at. I also love the first 2 acts of this film as the tension and horror amounts.This film is not going to be for everyone. The lack of dialogue might annoy people and make it difficult for people to invest in the character. The last act and ending are a forceful way to tie everything together, and not everyone will understand it. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this one massively and hope to see more interesting films like this one.","1 October 2023","7/10",NA
"No One Will Save You (2023","A film that might ""alienate"" you","MovieWarfare","I'm so glad I ran into this because it really delivered on all levels to be honest. No One Will Save You is a nice blend of Signs (on steroids) with Faster (2010), a movie that puts the pedal to the metal and leaves it there. No slow downs, no stops, just kept going forward, through and through, like a machine from Mad Max.Of course, you do have to take in consideration its budget, which wasn't huge, but apart from that, this movie looked great, felt good and was one hell of a ride. A movie where the protagonist takes smart decisions, where the CGI doesn't disappoint and there is even depth to it. I truly liked it, it's not something like The Ritual, but it does come close, because it feels...not claustrophobic but you do feel like you're running out of air. You can clearly notice the good writing in it, action without dialogue felt superb and a great job done by the lead.No reason to skip it, if you're a sci fi fan or a horror one, get it, view it, and buckle up. It will feel like a roller coaster, taking all the right corners. Amazing job done on such a low budget. Well done guys, well done.Cheers!","22 September 2023","7/10",NA

Kaitlyn Dever carries the movie and does it exceptionally well - its a fine perormance by an actress that will grow and grow and I can see her with a Streep like status in a few decades time - you can see it in her face. To the reviewer who skipped through it and claims there is ""not one line"" of dialogue... well, that's what you get for skipping.... My one criticism is I didn't really get the ending, as well done as it was, but that may just be me. I have thoughts on it but hopefully some other reviewer will clarify. This would be best seen on a big screen but regardless of where you see it, I think you will enjoy it and find the 90 minutes flies by. It also stays in your head afterwards which I always think is the mark of a good film. Enjoy.","22 September 2023","8/10",NA
"No One Will Save You (2023","This isn't perfect....","durham100","I recently watched No One Will Save You (2023), which was added to Hulu today. The storyline centers around a young woman who discovers strange circles in her yard, leading to a chilling revelation that she is their target. As her destiny unfolds, she faces the ominous question of what will be done to her and whether survival is even possible.This movie is both written and directed by Brian Duffield (Spontaneous) and features a talented cast including Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart), Lauren L. Murray (Paradise Lost), Geraldine Singer (Get Out), Dane Rhodes (The Magnificent Seven) and Zack Duhame (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood).Hulu delivers an outstanding cinematic experience with this film. It stands out as one of the best alien horror movies I've seen since Signs. The aliens and special effects are truly top-notch, showcasing some of the most impressive alien designs I've ever witnessed within the horror genre. The storyline exceeds expectations, featuring intelligent subplots that add depth to the unfolding narrative. Kaitlyn Dever's performance is exceptional, as she skillfully portrays curiosity, fear, and remorse throughout the film. The cinematography is pristine and utilizes drones effectively. The unexpected ending adds a unique twist to the story.In conclusion, No One Will Save You is a top-tier science fiction horror film that demands your attention.

"No One Will Save You (2023","Unfortunately","tchitouniaram","I watched ""No One Will Save You"" based on a glowing recommendation from my favorite author--Stephen King. It seems as if the Master of Horror and I's tastes in the horror/thriller genre do not exactly line up.For a very basic overview, this film tells the story of Brynn (Kaitlyn Dever)--a young woman who happens to be the town pariah based on a tragic past event she seemingly perpetuated. As such, Brynn lives a hermit-like lifestyle on the outskirts of the city limits--until one night she is visited by an alien creature that puts her through a terrifying ordeal.If that description seems vague to you--well, you have already identified the major problem with ""No One Will Save You"". It is, even by the admission of director Brian Duffield, a film to which anyone can mold to suit their own thematic interpretations. The thought here is that such flexibility creates intrigue. The problem? It doesn't.""No One Will Save You"" is essentially a collection of horror/thriller/drama tropes mixed together to give enough of a grab bag from which many possible interpretations can be pulled. Yet, none of those theses are ""supported by the text"", if you will. The movie is so minimalistic that any interpretation is based on the bare minimum of information--not exactly a rich tapestry from which to build a plot or character study.Also, as much as I enjoy Dever as an actress, even she couldn't move the needle all that far for me on this one. With almost no dialogue and limited opportunities to do much besides run, look terrified, and stare at events transpiring around her, she feels a little wasted here.Though ""No One Will Save You"" pulls a few twists out of its repertoire and zigs on occasion when you are expecting a zag, those are the only things the flick has going for it--and the only reasons it isn't even further down towards the bottom of the genre barrel.","3 October 2023","7/10",NA

"No One Will Save You (2023","No One Will Save You: Looks the part but goes nowhere","Platypuschow","In the small town of Mill River, Brynn Adams (Kaitlyn Dever) lives on the edge of town in her isolated home only occasionally venturing into town as she's not welcome due to an incident involving her former best friend Maude Collins. During the night, Brynn is awoken by strange noises from in her home that soon prove to be unearthly in nature and a prelude of a bigger nightmare to come.No One Will Save You is the sophomore feature of Brian Duffield following his 2020 debut Spontaneous. The script was acquired by 20th Century Fox in a competitive bidding war and featured up and coming actress Kaitlyn Dever attached as the lead who'd earned strong acclaim in miniseries such as Unbelievable and Dopesick as well as the 2019 film Booksmart. Largely shot under the radar on a modest budget (roughly $23 million), the movie now makes a rather lowkey debut on Hulu and while it is overall good, I'll admit I did find myself less engaged in the third act.One of the major defining features of No One Will Save You is that with the exception of one line, the film has no spoken dialogue and this is a purely visual film in terms of creating story and characterization. Kaitlyn Dever has proven herself time and time again as a reliable actress and that's no less true here as she takes what's essentially a one woman show for much of the time and must create a character purely through facial expressions and pantomime and it really works as you get an idea for her character and the situation in her town without a word being spoken. Once the aliens show up, the movie puts its minimalist setting to good use and despite the aliens being somewhat conventional in nature, Duffield finds unique ways of using them (and to a degree justifying their appearance) and we get some really memorable sequences of Brynn either hiding from the aliens or being chased by them. I do have some misgivings about the film especially in how it maybe stretches itself a little much in its minimalist dialogue with a scene towards the middle of the film where Brynn doesn't file a police report (which they try to justify to mixed results in my opinion). The movie also has a third act that tries to tie back to the incident with Brynn's friend Maude and while I think it is better handled than how Signs handled similar traumatic incidents in its take on aliens, it didn't quite hit the mark for me especially with the rather strange note the movie ends on.It's honestly a shame this movie's been released on Hulu instead of in theaters, because I can see this being exactly the kind of low budget high concept genre film that's begging to be experienced with a full auditorium that would see it perform in the company of films such as Super 8 and A Quiet Place. While I have my personal misgivings about the end result, I applaud Duffield for trying to do something out of convention with the alien sci-fi genre and Dever continues to show what a strong actress she is. That alone makes it worth a viewing in my opinion.","22 September 2023","5/10",NA

"No One Will Save You (2023","Unfortunately","tchitouniaram","I watched ""No One Will Save You"" based on a glowing recommendation from my favorite author--Stephen King. It seems as if the Master of Horror and I's tastes in the horror/thriller genre do not exactly line up.For a very basic overview, this film tells the story of Brynn (Kaitlyn Dever)--a young woman who happens to be the town pariah based on a tragic past event she seemingly perpetuated. As such, Brynn lives a hermit-like lifestyle on the outskirts of the city limits--until one night she is visited by an alien creature that puts her through a terrifying ordeal.If that description seems vague to you--well, you have already identified the major problem with ""No One Will Save You"".

"No One Will Save You (2023","No One Will Save You: Looks the part but goes nowhere","Platypuschow","In the small town of Mill River, Brynn Adams (Kaitlyn Dever) lives on the edge of town in her isolated home only occasionally venturing into town as she's not welcome due to an incident involving her former best friend Maude Collins. During the night, Brynn is awoken by strange noises from in her home that soon prove to be unearthly in nature and a prelude of a bigger nightmare to come.No One Will Save You is the sophomore feature of Brian Duffield following his 2020 debut Spontaneous. The script was acquired by 20th Century Fox in a competitive bidding war and featured up and coming actress Kaitlyn Dever attached as the lead who'd earned strong acclaim in miniseries such as Unbelievable and Dopesick as well as the 2019 film Booksmart. Largely shot under the radar on a modest budget (roughly $23 million), the movie now makes a rather lowkey debut on Hulu and while it is overall good, I'll admit I did find myself less engaged in the third act.One of the major defining features of No One Will Save You is that with the exception of one line, the film has no spoken dialogue and this is a purely visual film in terms of creating story and characterization. Kaitlyn Dever has proven herself time and time again as a reliable actress and that's no less true here as she takes what's essentially a one woman show for much of the time and must create a character purely through facial expressions and pantomime and it really works as you get an idea for her character and the situation in her town without a word being spoken. Once the aliens show up, the movie puts its minimalist setting to good use and despite the aliens being somewhat conventional in nature, Duffield finds unique ways of using them (and to a degree justifying their appearance) and we get some really memorable sequences of Brynn either hiding from the aliens or being chased by them. I do have some misgivings about the film especially in how it maybe stretches itself a little much in its minimalist dialogue with a scene towards the middle of the film where Brynn doesn't file a police report (which they try to justify to mixed results in my opinion). The movie also has a third act that tries to tie back to the incident with Brynn's friend Maude and while I think it is better handled than how Signs handled similar traumatic incidents in its take on aliens, it didn't quite hit the mark for me especially with the rather strange note the movie ends on.It's honestly a shame this movie's been released on Hulu instead of in theaters, because I can see this being exactly the kind of low budget high concept genre film that's begging to be experienced with a full auditorium that would see it perform in the company of films such as Super 8 and A Quiet Place. While I have my personal misgivings about the end result, I applaud Duffield for trying to do something out of convention with the alien sci-fi genre and Dever continues to show what a strong actress she is. That alone makes it worth a viewing in my opinion.","22 September 2023","5/10",NA
"No One Will Save You (2023","Brian Duffield delivers an engaging alien invasion thriller with a strong performance by Kaitlyn Dever, even with a messy third act","IonicBreezeMachine","I am always interested in people doing something new and this film certainly does that. It already felt different when the premise was a home invasion with aliens. However, it also has minimal dialogue with maybe 5 whole dialogue throughout the whole 90 minutes.Massive props to the lead actress, Kaitlyn Dever, as the main character Brynn. She has the job of conveying the emotions of her character solely by facial and body language which she succeeds at. I also love the first 2 acts of this film as the tension and horror amounts.This film is not going to be for everyone. The lack of dialogue might annoy people and make it difficult for people to invest in the character. The last act and ending are a forceful way to tie everything together, and not everyone will understand it. Nevertheless, I enjoyed this one massively and hope to see more interesting films like this one.","1 October 2023","7/10",NA

No One Will Save You is a nice blend of Signs (on steroids) with Faster (2010), a movie that puts the pedal to the metal and leaves it there. No slow downs, no stops, just kept going forward, through and through, like a machine from Mad Max.Of course, you do have to take in consideration its budget, which wasn't huge, but apart from that, this movie looked great, felt good and was one hell of a ride. A movie where the protagonist takes smart decisions, where the CGI doesn't disappoint and there is even depth to it. I truly liked it, it's not something like The Ritual, but it does come close, because it feels...not claustrophobic but you do feel like you're running out of air. You can clearly notice the good writing in it, action without dialogue felt superb and a great job done by the lead.No reason to skip it, if you're a sci fi fan or a horror one, get it, view it, and buckle up. It will feel like a roller coaster, taking all the right corners. Amazing job done on such a low budget. Well done guys, well done.Cheers!","22 September 2023","7/10",NA

Kaitlyn Dever carries the movie and does it exceptionally well - its a fine perormance by an actress that will grow and grow and I can see her with a Streep like status in a few decades time - you can see it in her face. To the reviewer who skipped through it and claims there is ""not one line"" of dialogue... well, that's what you get for skipping.... My one criticism is I didn't really get the ending, as well done as it was, but that may just be me. I have thoughts on it but hopefully some other reviewer will clarify. This would be best seen on a big screen but regardless of where you see it, I think you will enjoy it and find the 90 minutes flies by.

"No One Will Save You (2023","A Vacuum Of A Film That Can't Escape Its Own Ambiguity","zkonedog","A competent exhibition of visual storytelling, fraught with genuine tension and tidy build-ups. It is far from the typical chaos-filled approaches of alien invasion features. And I must admit, the technical crew had outdone themselves, as both the pictorial exhibition and the auditory representation have been terrific.What impresses me the most is that the script had almost no dialogue (save for the two lines spoken at the climactic portion). Yet, it was successful in not only maintaining suspense in eventful situations but also in characterising the grief-stricken protagonist and her tainted past. All these made this stand out from the rest, like a breath of fresh air in the midst of tedious repetitions.P. S. Kaitlyn Dever had done an incredible job! It's not easy to act when there are no verbal lines to support your enactment; you have got to do it all by yourself, and that's what she did! Just incredible.","24 September 2023","3/10",NA

First of all, I want to say, What fantastic casting! Each member of the ensemble played their part with lots of passion and commitment.Nimra Bucha plays the antagonist, and she does an excellent job. So it was with Ritu Arya as Lena, who plays the gullible but fierce elder sister with grace. Then there's Priya Kansara, the undisputed star of the show. What an astonishing act!

"Polite Society (2023)","A very fun homage hodgepodge","davidbleavitt","Greetings again from the darkness. If you have ever wondered what it might look like if Quentin Tarantino consulted on a modernized Pakistani version of Jane Austen ... well, writer-director Nida Manzoor shows us (with no actual assistance from QT), including stylized martial arts, class warfare, and an obsession with a stuntwoman career. It's Ms. Manzoor's first feature film (she created the TV series ""We are Lady Parts"") and she presents an extremely creative film with a balance of silly and dark themes that proves immensely entertaining.Relative newcomer Priya Kansara stars as Ria, a private school student highly determined to achieve her goal of becoming a working stuntwoman. She remains laser-focused on this despite her teacher and parents laughing off such nonsense and re-directing her towards becoming a doctor. Ria also adores her older sister Lena (Rita Arya), although worried about her since she recently dropped out of art school and seems to be rudderless in life.Things change quickly for everyone once rich mama's boy/doctor Salim (Akshay Khanna) begins courting Lena. Ria senses things aren't right with the relationship and is also convinced that Lena should resume her dreams of being artist, rather than being pursued by the handsome, rich, too-good-to-be-true suitor. Ria and her best friends Clara (Seraphina Beh) and Alba (Ella Bruccoleri) scheme to undercut the relationship, but they are no match for Salim's mother (a terrific Nimra Bucha), who sports the best evil Grinch grin you've ever seen.Director Manzoor divides the film into five chapters: A tale of two sisters, EID Soiree, Operation Wife Hunter, Assault on Shah mansion, and The Wedding. Each chapter offers comedy and action, and a matching of Ria's wits and instincts against the plans and beliefs of others. Ms. Kansara impresses as an upstart female Jackie Chan with superior acting chops. She executes the physical martial arts sequences beautifully, yet also shows promise in the quieter, more intimate moments when emoting and dialogue matter. She is certainly one to watch ... as is filmmaker Nida Manzoor. Anyone who can entertain at this level deserves the opportunity to do so as frequently as possible.Opening in theaters on April 28, 2023.","27 April 2023","8/10",NA

"Polite Society (2023)","fun and different","SnoopyStyle","A lot of original films are hitting theatres lately and I am not complaining. Polite Society is one that flew under the radar for me though, as I just heard about it about a month ago. I am happy I decided to try it because it was very enjoyable. I will ultimately recommend this film throughout my review, but I have to say up front that it still underwhelmed me upon reflection. Although not completely satisfying, here is why Polite Society deserves more attention.Ria (Priya Kansara), a young woman who is aspiring to become a Hollywood stuntwoman, makes it her mission to stop her sister Lena's (Ritu Arya) marriage. She believes that Salim (Akshay Khanna), the man she will be marrying, is hiding some big family secrets. Told through a fun visual style, Polite Society feels like it is trying to be the next Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, but it definitely falls short of that. It's a simple story of a woman trying to prevent her sister from being married, but over-the-top fist fights and science labs are also a huge aspect of this film.As much as I loved these characters and the story at hand was well-told, the style the filmmakers were going for was not utilized enough in my opinion. For such a simple premise, the crazy sequences sprinkled throughout the film were clearly meant to be fun and overdone on purpose. Sadly, everything I saw in the trailers is pretty much all I got from the final product. It never takes this great style and amplifies it, which made it seem like they were too afraid to push it too far. I would have walked out absolutely loving this film if they decided to go all in on the over-the-top stuff.Polite Society is a great showcase for both Kansara and Khanna. I have not seen them perform much on-screen, but I will gladly watch any project they are attached to. Their chemistry with one another was infectious and their characters were also very well-written. I commend Nida Manzoor for both writing and directing this film, seeing as I believe the story and characters were very good, but I just wish she took bigger chances visually. Due to the fact that I believe this film did not reach its fullest potential, I will not say you have to rush out and see it in theatres, but I think it is more than good enough to eventually spend your time watching it once it is streaming. Polite Society is now playing in theatres.","16 September 2023","7/10",NA

How cool is that right!? Even cooler is one girl's awesomely chose to be a stunt woman.

The result? I was right the first time - and more. It is an utter laugh out loud multi genre joy from start to finish. It is probably not for everyone - at times I was the only one laughing at the perhaps subtle humour. Is it a comedy? Is it a martial arts film? Is it a political drama? Is it a fantasy?

"Polite Society (2023)","A very fun homage hodgepodge","davidbleavitt","Greetings again from the darkness. If you have ever wondered what it might look like if Quentin Tarantino consulted on a modernized Pakistani version of Jane Austen ... well, writer-director Nida Manzoor shows us (with no actual assistance from QT), including stylized martial arts, class warfare, and an obsession with a stuntwoman career. It's Ms. Manzoor's first feature film (she created the TV series ""We are Lady Parts"") and she presents an extremely creative film with a balance of silly and dark themes that proves immensely entertaining.Relative newcomer Priya Kansara stars as Ria, a private school student highly determined to achieve her goal of becoming a working stuntwoman. She remains laser-focused on this despite her teacher and parents laughing off such nonsense and re-directing her towards becoming a doctor. Ria also adores her older sister Lena (Rita Arya), although worried about her since she recently dropped out of art school and seems to be rudderless in life.Things change quickly for everyone once rich mama's boy/doctor Salim (Akshay Khanna) begins courting Lena. Ria senses things aren't right with the relationship and is also convinced that Lena should resume her dreams of being artist, rather than being pursued by the handsome, rich, too-good-to-be-true suitor. Ria and her best friends Clara (Seraphina Beh) and Alba (Ella Bruccoleri) scheme to undercut the relationship, but they are no match for Salim's mother (a terrific Nimra Bucha), who sports the best evil Grinch grin you've ever seen.Director Manzoor divides the film into five chapters: A tale of two sisters, EID Soiree, Operation Wife Hunter, Assault on Shah mansion, and The Wedding. Each chapter offers comedy and action, and a matching of Ria's wits and instincts against the plans and beliefs of others. Ms. Kansara impresses as an upstart female Jackie Chan with superior acting chops. She executes the physical martial arts sequences beautifully, yet also shows promise in the quieter, more intimate moments when emoting and dialogue matter. She is certainly one to watch ... as is filmmaker Nida Manzoor. Anyone who can entertain at this level deserves the opportunity to do so as frequently as possible.Opening in theaters on April 28, 2023.","27 April 2023","8/10",NA

"Polite Society (2023)","fun and different","SnoopyStyle","A lot of original films are hitting theatres lately and I am not complaining. Polite Society is one that flew under the radar for me though, as I just heard about it about a month ago. I am happy I decided to try it because it was very enjoyable. I will ultimately recommend this film throughout my review, but I have to say up front that it still underwhelmed me upon reflection. Although not completely satisfying, here is why Polite Society deserves more attention.Ria (Priya Kansara), a young woman who is aspiring to become a Hollywood stuntwoman, makes it her mission to stop her sister Lena's (Ritu Arya) marriage. She believes that Salim (Akshay Khanna), the man she will be marrying, is hiding some big family secrets. Told through a fun visual style, Polite Society feels like it is trying to be the next Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, but it definitely falls short of that. It's a simple story of a woman trying to prevent her sister from being married, but over-the-top fist fights and science labs are also a huge aspect of this film.As much as I loved these characters and the story at hand was well-told, the style the filmmakers were going for was not utilized enough in my opinion. For such a simple premise, the crazy sequences sprinkled throughout the film were clearly meant to be fun and overdone on purpose. Sadly, everything I saw in the trailers is pretty much all I got from the final product. It never takes this great style and amplifies it, which made it seem like they were too afraid to push it too far. I would have walked out absolutely loving this film if they decided to go all in on the over-the-top stuff.Polite Society is a great showcase for both Kansara and Khanna. I have not seen them perform much on-screen, but I will gladly watch any project they are attached to.

Adequate. And the direction was off and on, with some really good moments but way too many closeups of faces just wordlessly. . .

Mom tempted me at times two rethink that, but she eventually grew on me by the end. But after 3/4 of the way through, there was absolutely no advancement of the plot. You can chalk this up to some creative license or someone trying to be funny about not really telling the full story but damn, this just ended with absolutely nothing to go on.

They are unbelievable. The only people who think others behave this way are those who live in the echo chamber and have zero grasp on real life.And that brings me to the final point.

"Polite Society (2023)","a boring crap fear of half baked ideas","tgcme","What a pitiful, ham-fisted attempt at a slow burn...to nowhere. I see awards on the horizon: for Most Obtrusive Soundtrack and Worst Blatant Product Placement @ the Tip of a Catastrophe!I'm a fan of the 10 minute test for unknown quantity films. Given Amanda's (Juliet Roberts) grating, stage-y opening monologue, I very nearly abandoned this one at the 3:20 mark. Oh, to have a redo on that call! At least wait for Mahershala Ali, I told myself. He has second billing! Don't do it, people; don't wait for Mahershali Ali (GH). Of course he's good. But he's no saving grace here, because there is no grace. The good news is, he enters about 20 minutes in-the very bad news is there's still two hours left of this pointless poop. Denzel got out apparently; why oh why didn't I.I almost fled again, minutes later, right after a huge decision was made. Because the film lost all credibility for me then. That's the moment.Something unexplained, but clearly foreshadowing terrible things, had just occurred that was obviously tied to this person's request, yet: Two grown adults both failed to make that connection; second, their choice is entirely at odds with the power dynamic and proclivities of the people involved; and lastly, the new character is so pointedly telling a whopping lie it's inconceivable anyone would let it slide. Let alone anxious people perched at the edge of a crisis. But nooo, I had to stick around to see if Mahershala Ali (damn you!) was as mysterious as he seemed. Ha!After overstaying, among other things, I found myself wondering what the chances were, genetically, that a brown-eyed mother could give birth to only blue-eyed children (hint: not good), and the height of flamingoes. Let's just say the plot allows ample time to pursue your thoughts.Is the film trying to make a point about the dumbed-down, cynical, phone-addicted, helpless nature of Americans? Sure, but it dilutes its own suspense on the way to saying little about it.","10 December 2023","5/10",NA
"Polite Society (2023)","Thin soup, indeed.","DJWinston","Facing the apocalypse in a unique way is not an easy thing to do in movies, but director/screenwriter Sam Esmail takes Rumaan Alam's 2020 novel and turns it into an unrelenting 2023 psychological thriller that captures the current extremist political landscape and isolationist world view with sharp acuity. No one real is explicitly mentioned, but so much of the threat presented in the spiraling plot felt not only relevant but palpable. It starts with a last-minute family vacation in a Long Island mansion and the two strangers who enter their lives. Julia Roberts plays an unapologetically mistrustful woman with familiar conviction, while Ethan Hawke does what he can as her laid-back husband. As the mysterious stranger, Mahershala Ali has to play it close to the vest, while Kevin Bacon has an effective turn late in the story. I could've done without some of the contrived camera angles and predictable music cues, but overall the film got me thinking what I would do under similar circumstances.","9 December 2023","6/10",NA

I see awards on the horizon: for Most Obtrusive Soundtrack and Worst Blatant Product Placement @ the Tip of a Catastrophe!I'm a fan of the 10 minute test for unknown quantity films. Given Amanda's (Juliet Roberts) grating, stage-y opening monologue, I very nearly abandoned this one at the 3:20 mark. Oh, to have a redo on that call! At least wait for Mahershala Ali, I told myself. He has second billing! Don't do it, people; don't wait for Mahershali Ali (GH). Of course he's good. But he's no saving grace here, because there is no grace. The good news is, he enters about 20 minutes in-the very bad news is there's still two hours left of this pointless poop. Denzel got out apparently; why oh why didn't I.I almost fled again, minutes later, right after a huge decision was made. Because the film lost all credibility for me then. That's the moment.Something unexplained, but clearly foreshadowing terrible things, had just occurred that was obviously tied to this person's request, yet: Two grown adults both failed to make that connection; second, their choice is entirely at odds with the power dynamic and proclivities of the people involved; and lastly, the new character is so pointedly telling a whopping lie it's inconceivable anyone would let it slide. Let alone anxious people perched at the edge of a crisis. But nooo, I had to stick around to see if Mahershala Ali (damn you!) was as mysterious as he seemed. Ha!After overstaying, among other things, I found myself wondering what the chances were, genetically, that a brown-eyed mother could give birth to only blue-eyed children (hint: not good), and the height of flamingoes. Let's just say the plot allows ample time to pursue your thoughts.Is the film trying to make a point about the dumbed-down, cynical, phone-addicted, helpless nature of Americans? Sure, but it dilutes its own suspense on the way to saying little about it.","10 December 2023","5/10",NA
"Polite Society (2023)","Thin soup, indeed.","DJWinston","Facing the apocalypse in a unique way is not an easy thing to do in movies, but director/screenwriter Sam Esmail takes Rumaan Alam's 2020 novel and turns it into an unrelenting 2023 psychological thriller that captures the current extremist political landscape and isolationist world view with sharp acuity. No one real is explicitly mentioned, but so much of the threat presented in the spiraling plot felt not only relevant but palpable. It starts with a last-minute family vacation in a Long Island mansion and the two strangers who enter their lives. Julia Roberts plays an unapologetically mistrustful woman with familiar conviction, while Ethan Hawke does what he can as her laid-back husband. As the mysterious stranger, Mahershala Ali has to play it close to the vest, while Kevin Bacon has an effective turn late in the story.

"Saltburn (2023)","Its third act requires a HUGE suspension of disbelief","M_Exchange","Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don't waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker.","8 January 2024","6/10",NA
"Saltburn (2023)","Pretentious garbage!","mjw2305","Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.","24 December 2023","3/10",NA
"Saltburn (2023)","Didn't work for me","ThatDoesntMatter","Take a bit of A Separate Peace, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Brideshead Revisited, Howards End and many more, mix them up into a rather incoherent story, and you get this over-the-top bit of fluff. The problems are too numerous to mention, but the most glaring is that there's not a tad of credibility in the set-up. Stories that involve someone of one class mixing it up with someone of another must show there's a connection between the two people: that part is completely skipped over here. There's no connection at all between the two major characters. The bond is never explained.Then there's the issue of character: no one in the film is a real person: all of them are pawns to serve the grand plot which, when dissected, falls apart. These aren't people; they're vehicles for the screenwriter (director, producer, etc) to show off an interesting but ultimately flawed story.So much else is wrong with this movie but to give them all away would be to contain spoilers, and the reviews that are most worthwhile here at IMDB are the ones that warn the reader off a show.Consider yourself warned.","9 December 2023","3/10",NA
"Saltburn (2023)","Vastly Overrated, Obvious and Focused on Shock Value","brentsbulletinboard","It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.","24 November 2023","5/10",NA

"Saltburn (2023)","Pretentious garbage!","mjw2305","Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.","24 December 2023","3/10",NA

"Saltburn (2023)","Vastly Overrated, Obvious and Focused on Shock Value","brentsbulletinboard","It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.","24 November 2023","5/10",NA

It's the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one's watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What's more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it's a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there's the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who's quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director's cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don't waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker.","8 January 2024","6/10",NA
"Saltburn (2023)","Pretentious garbage!","mjw2305","Saltburn, directed by Emerald Fennell (who brought us the excellent A Promising Young Woman), is a psychological thriller drama that attempts to navigate the maze-like world of the English aristocracy, but unfortunately, it loses its way. The film stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at Oxford University, and Jacob Elordi as Felix Catton, a charming aristocrat who invites Oliver to spend a summer at his family's sprawling estate, Saltburn.Saltburn is set in the mid-2000s, a period marked by some economic and cultural decadence. It attempts to explore the clash of social classes, moral vacuity, and the seductions of wealth. However, the film's historical and cultural context feels superficial, failing to delve more deeply into the societal dynamics of the time. Despite being promising, the plot suffers from predictability and a lack of subtlety. The film tries to play with the idea of these enormous bastions of privilege and power as unique breeding grounds for strangeness, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Forced and repetitive dialogues, which frequently feel artificial and contrived, further weaken the narrative.Despite having talented actors portraying them, the characters lack depth. Oliver, played by Keoghan, is a hateful, lustful, and envious character, but his portrayal is flat and uncomplicated. Felix, played by Elordi, is a character who comes from a life of blatant privilege, but his flimsy compassion does not seem real.Although Fennell's direction is bold, it lacks the dexterity required to make this intricate story come to life. The film's pacing is erratic; certain scenes seem rushed, while others drag on needlessly. The movie's soundtrack seems haphazard and does not improve the story. The movie also occasionally goes a bit too far in terms of taste and may have you cringing.The cinematography and production design are perhaps the film's strongest points. The grandeur of Saltburn, the sprawling estate, is captured beautifully, and the film does a commendable job of creating a lived-in feeling that feels glamorous and filthy at the same time. These artistic components, however, are insufficient to make up for the film's weak narrative.Saltburn is a film that promises much but delivers little. Despite its grand setting and talented cast, it fails to provide a compelling narrative or engaging characters. It's a film that tries to be a critique of the English aristocracy and a psychological thriller but falls short on both counts. While it may appeal to some viewers for its aesthetic appeal, it's a film that, unfortunately, doesn't live up to its potential. It's not a film I'd recommend.","24 December 2023","3/10",NA

"Saltburn (2023)","Vastly Overrated, Obvious and Focused on Shock Value","brentsbulletinboard","It is 2006, and scholarship student Oliver Quick has just arrived at Oxford. He doesn't fit in with the upper-class atmosphere and has no acquaintances. After befriending Felix Catton, a popular and wealthy fellow student, however, Oliver finally seems to find his place at the University. Invited to the Catton family home- Saltburn- for the summer holidays, Oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods. Nothing is as it seems though, as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itself.Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, 'Saltburn' is an initially intriguing, though ultimately irritatingly derivative, predictable psychological comic-horror. Fennell's narrative begins with promise. In the first act, you aren't sure who to trust, nor where the story is heading. However, after the action moves to the manor house, Saltburn, things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films, be they 'The Talented Mr. Ripley, 'Teorema' or 'The Servant.'Those films examined themes such as class difference, obsessiveness, personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity. Fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes, never going into them with depth. Nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions. One, in particular, acts in a violent vacuum of self-obsession and jealously- but why? What made this character the way they are? Fennel never bothers to tell us, seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the dark.Moreover, her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches. Oliver is essentially just a less charismatic, Scouse Tom Ripley, with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness. Felix is exactly like Ripley's object of obsession, Dickie Greenleaf, while his eccentric family are people we've seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy- 'The Ruling Class' among them. Familiar and lacking in depth, Fennell's characters aren't particularly interesting, nor is her narrative particularly original. Further, while her dialogue is frequently funny, it can also be pretentious- particularly during Oliver's intermittent narration.Throughout the film, Fennell handles the material with great deference- too much, one might argue. She lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably, seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power. The ending, featuring full-frontal nudity- reminiscent of the music video to Liam Gallagher's 'Once,' starring a thankfully clothed Eric Cantona- seems self-indulgent and, shall we say, cocky. Furthermore, a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective, while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy; so completely does it abandon real-world logic.Conversely, Linus Sandgren's glossy cinematography is striking. Sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles, heightening the suspense of the narrative, as well as compounding the decadence of the Catton family. He employs a ratio of 1.33:1, giving the film a top-heavy, boxed-in look, making locations feel daunting. It is work full of contrast- although, a cynical critic might suggest an over-reliance on cliched visual metaphors, such as reflections, or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wings.However, Sandgren's visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings, as does Suzie Davies' rich production design. Textured and detailed, her work fosters a vivid, immersive atmosphere, which Sophie Canale's costume design and Charlotte Dirickx's set decoration compounds. In addition, Anthony Willis's score is stirring. His original pieces are seedy and evocative, while songs used throughout- perhaps most notably Sophie Ellis-Bextor's 'Murder On The Dancefloor'- complement the narrative.Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver, alongside Jacob Elordi as Felix, Alison Oliver as Felix's sister Venetia and Rosamund Pike as Felix's mother Elspeth. Keoghan is a fascinating actor, who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence. Here, however, he gives an inconsistent performance. When playing Oliver as a weird, insular personality, he shines; though when he has to display his dominant side Keoghan lacks conviction and doesn't convince- an oddly played, oddly written night-time scene with Venetia being clearest evidence of this.Elordi does much more assured work, despite the fact that the character is just a 2006 version of the aforementioned Greenleaf. He impresses though, overcoming the scant characterisation of the role. Oliver is excellent, underplaying the complexities of her character, while Pike steals the show as the eccentric Elspeth. Richard E. Grant also stars, as Felix's father, but is criminally under-utilised, while Archie Madekwe's grating performance as Felix's cousin is smug and one-note.In conclusion, Emerald Fennell's 'Saltburn' is a film trying to provoke, though isn't as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is. Though it is funny from time to time, and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful; the film is ultimately an uneven, predictable and derivative affair. While the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric, the performance of star Barry Keoghan is inconsistent. Although Rosamund Pike is a delight, the film around her is not worthy of her talents, nor can she save it completely. Not to rub salt in the wound, but this film doesn't burn as brightly as it could have.","24 November 2023","5/10",NA

"Saltburn (2023)","Its third act requires a HUGE suspension of disbelief","M_Exchange","Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don't like.

I didn't care much for her debut outing, ""Promising Young Woman"" (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, ""Saltburn."" This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. (Think ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep's clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to endanger viewer empathy, interest or even connection.

"Air (I) (2023)","A Great Portrayal of A Potential Boring Subject Matter","cdjh-81125","Really, really loved this movie. I know it's become a bit of an overused adage nowadays but this feels like the kind of movie we just don't get anymore.I've missed Ben Affleck as a director so much. I've liked every movie he's directed so far (even Live By Night) and this movie shows just how capable he is behind the camera. His directing is a big part of the reason why this film is as captivating as it is. He never just reverts to simple shot/reverse shot between actors during these long dialogue scenes but instead keeps the characters moving and energetic and it keeps the scenes visually interesting. Its also extremely well edited with the film being kept at a brisk pace with a runtime that feels just right for this story.But the dialogue here is unbelievable. It's consistently sharp and witty throughout and it keeps the conversations engaging without ever being showy or overwritten. As much as I love Aaron Sorkin dialogue his scenes can often come across as words written by a professional screenwriter rather than genuine interactions between characters but that's not the case here at all. But Air does what Sorkin scripts like the Social Network and Moneyball do extremely successfully and take very non-cinematic subject matters and makes them riveting, captivating watches.I was a bit mixed on Affleck's choice to never directly show Michael Jordan on screen. I understand the creative choice but the attempts to hide Jordan on screen often came across as more distracting than I think it would've been had Jordan just been portrayed as an actual character by an actor giving a performance.But overall this was a great watch. I'm so glad Amazon are giving this a full theatrical release because it deserves to be seen on the big screen and I sincerely hope this is a sign of things to come not just from Amazon but streamers as a whole.","15 April 2023","9/10",NA
"Air (I) (2023)","Ben Affleck Directs Another Winner","kjproulx","I'm a pretty big fan of films that revolve around the behind-the-scenes drama of professional sports. Films like Air will always grab my attention and become a must-see in my mind. For that reason alone, on top of knowing that Ben Affleck directed it, I had high hopes as well. After seeing it, I'm happy to say that I had a great time at the movies. This supremely written film deserves your attention and here's why.Decades ago, the company of Nike wasn't worth all that much and not many athletes even wanted to be sponsored by them. Air tells the story of Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon), a man who is on the verge of his career ending, when he gets the crazy idea to put the entire good will and fortune of the Nike brand at risk. He risks everything to try and get Michael Jordan to agree to sign with them, thus designing what is widely known now as the Air Jordan shoe. It's a very simple story about a man who knows the potential of something, while everyone around him thinks what he wants to accomplish is impossible. It's an underdog story that's not even directly about an athlete and it's done incredibly well.The star of this film is easily Alex Convery. You haven't heard of him? Well, until today I hadn't either. He is the screenwriter of this film and the dialogue from start to finish is what took this film from the generic true story category to something that's a must-watch. This is his first screenplay, ever. Yes, a film that I will currently call my favourite of the year so far, was written by a guy who had never written a feature film outside of this one (at least none that got made). Hearing about this just made me ludicrously excited that people still get chances taken on them in Hollywood. Convery wrote a terrific screenplay here and I hope he continues to get work.Ben Affleck does a great job directing this film, getting fantastic performances out of everyone involved. Matt Damon is committed and it's one of his best performances in years. Jason Bateman's dry humour is all over this movie and I couldn't get enough of it. Viola Davis as Michael Jordan's mother was also great (as always), but who really stood out to me as the MVP was Chris Tucker. He's both funny and hits all the dramatic beats his character required. I haven't seen him in a meaty role like this in a while and I was pleasantly surprised.Look, I'm not about to sit here and say this is one of the best films of all time or that it's groundbreaking in any way, but Air just ticked all the boxes of enjoyment for me. Well-acted, well-written, well-directed, it's fun to watch and even though you know how the story ends, it's still very engaging. For non-sports fans or people who don't know about sponsorships and how they work in professional sports, I think Air is still a movie for you because it never showcases any actual Basketball (other than on a television) and the inner workings of this company is just interesting in general. Air is now playing in theatres and I think many people will enjoy it. I absolutely recommend this one.","12 April 2023","9/10",NA
"Air (I) (2023)","Really solid entertainment","rdoyle29","This is an extremely engaging and entertaining film that manages to mine suspense out of a story you already know the ending of. You know that Nike ... at the time the third place loser in the basketball shoe market ... managed to get Michael Jordan to sign with them and created the Air Jordan shoe. To a large degree the film is about HOW Sonny Vaccaro (in the form of Matt Damon) pulled off this feat, but it also makes you doubt IF it's going to happen. That's good storytelling.It's also a pretty funny film ... more than I expected. Mostly due to Jason Bateman, Chris Turcker (who I am not a fan of, but is really quite good here) and a bravely self-deprecating Ben Affleck, although Dave Messina steals many scenes as Jordan's agent.It's really so well put together than you start to forget that Nike is hardly an underdog, and this is really a film about a multi-billion dollar company becoming even bigger and making a soon-to-be-very-wealthy athlete even wealthier. It's a nice trick.My only real complaint about the film is that it's WAY too dedicated to reminding you that it's set in 1984.","5 April 2023","8/10",NA
"Air (I) (2023)","Affleck bounces back as a director","Jeremy_Urquhart","This was a nice surprise. After the shaky Live By Night in 2016 (which I think was affected more by executive meddling than anything else), Ben Affleck took a break from directing, and now has a mini comeback of sorts with Air. It's been about a decade since I watched his other films (Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and Argo), but I remember liking them quite a bit, and enough to say that Air feels like a return to form for Affleck as a director.It's most comparable to Argo in that it takes an interesting story from history, and gives it a classic Hollywood level of polish that makes things a bit snappier, more entertaining, and a little funnier, too. Here, it's all about Nike trying to partner with a young Michael Jordan in the mid-80s. I know nothing about basketball, but have always known Jordan and Nike go together. So the film's only likely to be suspenseful for those who've been living under particularly large rocks for a particularly long time, but it's not so much the what that's interesting, but the how.The cast all give very strong performances, and between this and The Last Duel, I have to say that I think Affleck's even better in supporting roles than lead ones. It moves well and kept me interested for nearly two hours, even though the story on paper wasn't one I thought I'd find interesting. That's the sign of a good movie, sometimes.However, Air's not quite a slam dunk. The writing takes some jarring shortcuts here and there, and keeping this under two hours also made for some occasionally weird edits. And the soundtrack may have laid it on a little thick at times (but hearing two Violent Femmes tracks was cool, and not only is Bruce Springsteen discussed in dialogue, but he's also in the soundtrack, which is always a win in my book).Affleck and Damon haven't had a big win in a while, but they made a good movie together here and I hope it does well. It's worth seeking out for the clean, efficient, and all-around solid entertainment it provides.","2 April 2023","7/10",NA

Not necessarily a shoe guy, however this movie paints the picture as to why people invest in these shoes. The directing was fantastic. Stellar cast. Matt Damon bringing his A Game as always. Chris Tucker just added his magic to this movie. Jason Bateman just being a supporting character was interesting, but his story really added to the stakes of the movie. The pacing was a little off here, and there but the story, and cast really allows this movie to breathe in away you don't worry about the pace like that.

"Air (I) (2023)","Beauty in Simplicity","gwzct","We need more films like this right now. No agenda. No politics. Just an interesting (and true) story that entertains us. Write some dialogue, grab some cameras, get solid actors, and go to work. There's nothing complicated in this film. There no mystery to solve, no giant set pieces, just a fantastic time on the screen. The 80s are shown a ton of love in every aspect of the film. I am liking Matt Damon more as an actor as his career moves on. He's not above setting his star power aside and concentrate on being an actor and it works so well here. Too much can never be said about Ben Affleck as a director. He's one of the best working right now. As solid a movie as you will ever watch.","18 May 2023","9/10",NA
"Air (I) (2023)","Absolutely NOT a sports fan, but really liked this movie","thejdrage","I actually rated it at 7.5 stars. Ben Affleck's acting wasn't as good as we know it could have been. The strain of being on both sides of the camera showed - but damn he was great as a director!! Also felt that Chris Tucker's usual comedy set him apart for such a strong part.So, I am absolutely NOT a sports fan and I don't wear Air Jordan shoes. HOWEVER, it was fun to see that Peter Moore, the original creator of the shoe, did, indeed, make them a work of art from the very beginning - once he was given free reign. That made me the happiest!! I DO love looking at Air Jordan's and they are absolutely BEAUTIFUL!This movie about sports and sport clothes was brilliantly done due to the fact that everyone in it felt free to be very natural.Some reviewers don't like that we never see Michael Jordan's face. I did like it. He is FAR too well-known to be played by an actor. AND this movie really wan't about him, per se. It was very much about his mother and what she did not only for him, but for everyone in sports.This is a movie for everyone. ENJOY!!","29 March 2023","8/10",NA
"Air (I) (2023)","Can Ben Affleck and Matt Damon always make movies together","burntoutboy","I managed to watch this at an early screening and I was pleasantly surprised.Of course most people know Michael Jordan and how he arguably is the best basketball player of all time and potentially best athlete of all time. But I bet a fair few people don't know the behind the doors story of how the most popular sneaker came into creation. This is where Air comes in.Right from the very start, the movie brings you along for the journey, engaging at every possible moment instead of just telling it to your face. The script was really well written to achieve this.The acting was too notch, particularly from Damon and Davis. At times you forget they are portraying real people.It was surprisingly funny at times and whilst you know the end of the story, the movie still gets you routing for everything to work out.For me, this is the first Oscar worthy film of the year (primarily for acting and screenplay) but credit should also be given to Afflecks direction. Just like Argo, he's got another directorial hit and his hands.","5 April 2023","9/10",NA

For someone that doesn't really keep up much with sports this was enthralling, very informative, and quite entertaining. I loved Air I can't praise enough I had a lot of fun. The comedy was better than expected especially everything with Chris Messina and Matt Damon bantering. I wasn't sure why Micheal Jordan barely had lines at all even though the movie had a lot to do with him even that was crafty, the bulk is about Nike corporation which was all great. I hope the ratings/reviews get plenty of praise even awards.","7 April 2023","9/10",NA
"Air (I) (2023)","Surprisingly entertaining biopic about the rise of a sports brand","trevorwomble","Nike are now synonymous with sports and sportswear, and Adidas's great rivals, however it wasn't always that way and this little film explains how they did it.This film started off as a made for streaming movie, small(ish) in scale and with a decent but not spectacular budget. However the casting of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (both in front of and behind the camera) really brought it up to another level. Whilst the final result still feels like a glorified TV movie, Damon is excellent as usual and for once Affleck doesn't seem to be punching above his weight as an actor. This is actually a very well made and acted film, although the slight story may not be to everyone's taste.Viola Davis and Julius Tannon also turn in a good performances as Michael Jordan's devoted parents. There are also solid turns from Chris Tucker (looking a few pounds heavier than the last time I saw him in anything worthwhile) and Jason Bateman amongst others.It's an interesting subject matter and I enjoyed the soundtrack too (many 80s songs of my youth) although it does have a lot of swearing so may not be appropriate for all. Ben Affleck is a very capable director and this is another good movie from him. If you enjoyed more recent biopic films like 'The Founder' and 'Steve Jobs' then you should enjoy this.","7 April 2023","8/10",NA

To a large degree the film is about HOW Sonny Vaccaro (in the form of Matt Damon) pulled off this feat, but it also makes you doubt IF it's going to happen. That's good storytelling.It's also a pretty funny film ... more than I expected. Mostly due to Jason Bateman, Chris Turcker (who I am not a fan of, but is really quite good here) and a bravely self-deprecating Ben Affleck, although Dave Messina steals many scenes as Jordan's agent.It's really so well put together than you start to forget that Nike is hardly an underdog, and this is really a film about a multi-billion dollar company becoming even bigger and making a soon-to-be-very-wealthy athlete even wealthier. It's a nice trick.My only real complaint about the film is that it's WAY too dedicated to reminding you that it's set in 1984.","5 April 2023","8/10",NA
"Air (I) (2023)","Affleck bounces back as a director","Jeremy_Urquhart","This was a nice surprise. After the shaky Live By Night in 2016 (which I think was affected more by executive meddling than anything else), Ben Affleck took a break from directing, and now has a mini comeback of sorts with Air. It's been about a decade since I watched his other films (Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and Argo), but I remember liking them quite a bit, and enough to say that Air feels like a return to form for Affleck as a director.It's most comparable to Argo in that it takes an interesting story from history, and gives it a classic Hollywood level of polish that makes things a bit snappier, more entertaining, and a little funnier, too. Here, it's all about Nike trying to partner with a young Michael Jordan in the mid-80s. I know nothing about basketball, but have always known Jordan and Nike go together. So the film's only likely to be suspenseful for those who've been living under particularly large rocks for a particularly long time, but it's not so much the what that's interesting, but the how.The cast all give very strong performances, and between this and The Last Duel, I have to say that I think Affleck's even better in supporting roles than lead ones. It moves well and kept me interested for nearly two hours, even though the story on paper wasn't one I thought I'd find interesting. That's the sign of a good movie, sometimes.However, Air's not quite a slam dunk. The writing takes some jarring shortcuts here and there, and keeping this under two hours also made for some occasionally weird edits. And the soundtrack may have laid it on a little thick at times (but hearing two Violent Femmes tracks was cool, and not only is Bruce Springsteen discussed in dialogue, but he's also in the soundtrack, which is always a win in my book).Affleck and Damon haven't had a big win in a while, but they made a good movie together here and I hope it does well. It's worth seeking out for the clean, efficient, and all-around solid entertainment it provides.","2 April 2023","7/10",NA

There no mystery to solve, no giant set pieces, just a fantastic time on the screen. The 80s are shown a ton of love in every aspect of the film. I am liking Matt Damon more as an actor as his career moves on. He's not above setting his star power aside and concentrate on being an actor and it works so well here.

"Air (I) (2023)","Absolutely NOT a sports fan, but really liked this movie","thejdrage","I actually rated it at 7.5 stars. Ben Affleck's acting wasn't as good as we know it could have been. The strain of being on both sides of the camera showed - but damn he was great as a director!! Also felt that Chris Tucker's usual comedy set him apart for such a strong part.So, I am absolutely NOT a sports fan and I don't wear Air Jordan shoes. HOWEVER, it was fun to see that Peter Moore, the original creator of the shoe, did, indeed, make them a work of art from the very beginning - once he was given free reign. That made me the happiest!! I DO love looking at Air Jordan's and they are absolutely BEAUTIFUL!This movie about sports and sport clothes was brilliantly done due to the fact that everyone in it felt free to be very natural.Some reviewers don't like that we never see Michael Jordan's face. I did like it. He is FAR too well-known to be played by an actor. AND this movie really wan't about him, per se. It was very much about his mother and what she did not only for him, but for everyone in sports.This is a movie for everyone. ENJOY!!","29 March 2023","8/10",NA
"Air (I) (2023)","Can Ben Affleck and Matt Damon always make movies together","burntoutboy","I managed to watch this at an early screening and I was pleasantly surprised.Of course most people know Michael Jordan and how he arguably is the best basketball player of all time and potentially best athlete of all time. But I bet a fair few people don't know the behind the doors story of how the most popular sneaker came into creation. This is where Air comes in.Right from the very start, the movie brings you along for the journey, engaging at every possible moment instead of just telling it to your face. The script was really well written to achieve this.The acting was too notch, particularly from Damon and Davis. At times you forget they are portraying real people.It was surprisingly funny at times and whilst you know the end of the story, the movie still gets you routing for everything to work out.For me, this is the first Oscar worthy film of the year (primarily for acting and screenplay) but credit should also be given to Afflecks direction. Just like Argo, he's got another directorial hit and his hands.","5 April 2023","9/10",NA

For someone that doesn't really keep up much with sports this was enthralling, very informative, and quite entertaining. I loved Air I can't praise enough I had a lot of fun. The comedy was better than expected especially everything with Chris Messina and Matt Damon bantering. I wasn't sure why Micheal Jordan barely had lines at all even though the movie had a lot to do with him even that was crafty, the bulk is about Nike corporation which was all great. I hope the ratings/reviews get plenty of praise even awards.","7 April 2023","9/10",NA
"Air (I) (2023)","Surprisingly entertaining biopic about the rise of a sports brand","trevorwomble","Nike are now synonymous with sports and sportswear, and Adidas's great rivals, however it wasn't always that way and this little film explains how they did it.This film started off as a made for streaming movie, small(ish) in scale and with a decent but not spectacular budget. However the casting of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (both in front of and behind the camera) really brought it up to another level. Whilst the final result still feels like a glorified TV movie, Damon is excellent as usual and for once Affleck doesn't seem to be punching above his weight as an actor. This is actually a very well made and acted film, although the slight story may not be to everyone's taste.Viola Davis and Julius Tannon also turn in a good performances as Michael Jordan's devoted parents. There are also solid turns from Chris Tucker (looking a few pounds heavier than the last time I saw him in anything worthwhile) and Jason Bateman amongst others.It's an interesting subject matter and I enjoyed the soundtrack too (many 80s songs of my youth) although it does have a lot of swearing so may not be appropriate for all. Ben Affleck is a very capable director and this is another good movie from him. If you enjoyed more recent biopic films like 'The Founder' and 'Steve Jobs' then you should enjoy this.","7 April 2023","8/10",NA
"Air (I) (2023)","A Great Portrayal of A Potential Boring Subject Matter","cdjh-81125","Really, really loved this movie. I know it's become a bit of an overused adage nowadays but this feels like the kind of movie we just don't get anymore.I've missed Ben Affleck as a director so much. I've liked every movie he's directed so far (even Live By Night) and this movie shows just how capable he is behind the camera. His directing is a big part of the reason why this film is as captivating as it is. He never just reverts to simple shot/reverse shot between actors during these long dialogue scenes but instead keeps the characters moving and energetic and it keeps the scenes visually interesting. Its also extremely well edited with the film being kept at a brisk pace with a runtime that feels just right for this story.But the dialogue here is unbelievable. It's consistently sharp and witty throughout and it keeps the conversations engaging without ever being showy or overwritten. As much as I love Aaron Sorkin dialogue his scenes can often come across as words written by a professional screenwriter rather than genuine interactions between characters but that's not the case here at all. But Air does what Sorkin scripts like the Social Network and Moneyball do extremely successfully and take very non-cinematic subject matters and makes them riveting, captivating watches.I was a bit mixed on Affleck's choice to never directly show Michael Jordan on screen. I understand the creative choice but the attempts to hide Jordan on screen often came across as more distracting than I think it would've been had Jordan just been portrayed as an actual character by an actor giving a performance.But overall this was a great watch. I'm so glad Amazon are giving this a full theatrical release because it deserves to be seen on the big screen and I sincerely hope this is a sign of things to come not just from Amazon but streamers as a whole.","15 April 2023","9/10",NA
"Air (I) (2023)","Ben Affleck Directs Another Winner","kjproulx","I'm a pretty big fan of films that revolve around the behind-the-scenes drama of professional sports. Films like Air will always grab my attention and become a must-see in my mind. For that reason alone, on top of knowing that Ben Affleck directed it, I had high hopes as well. After seeing it, I'm happy to say that I had a great time at the movies. This supremely written film deserves your attention and here's why.Decades ago, the company of Nike wasn't worth all that much and not many athletes even wanted to be sponsored by them. Air tells the story of Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon), a man who is on the verge of his career ending, when he gets the crazy idea to put the entire good will and fortune of the Nike brand at risk. He risks everything to try and get Michael Jordan to agree to sign with them, thus designing what is widely known now as the Air Jordan shoe. It's a very simple story about a man who knows the potential of something, while everyone around him thinks what he wants to accomplish is impossible. It's an underdog story that's not even directly about an athlete and it's done incredibly well.The star of this film is easily Alex Convery. You haven't heard of him? Well, until today I hadn't either. He is the screenwriter of this film and the dialogue from start to finish is what took this film from the generic true story category to something that's a must-watch. This is his first screenplay, ever. Yes, a film that I will currently call my favourite of the year so far, was written by a guy who had never written a feature film outside of this one (at least none that got made). Hearing about this just made me ludicrously excited that people still get chances taken on them in Hollywood. Convery wrote a terrific screenplay here and I hope he continues to get work.Ben Affleck does a great job directing this film, getting fantastic performances out of everyone involved. Matt Damon is committed and it's one of his best performances in years. Jason Bateman's dry humour is all over this movie and I couldn't get enough of it. Viola Davis as Michael Jordan's mother was also great (as always), but who really stood out to me as the MVP was Chris Tucker. He's both funny and hits all the dramatic beats his character required. I haven't seen him in a meaty role like this in a while and I was pleasantly surprised.Look, I'm not about to sit here and say this is one of the best films of all time or that it's groundbreaking in any way, but Air just ticked all the boxes of enjoyment for me. Well-acted, well-written, well-directed, it's fun to watch and even though you know how the story ends, it's still very engaging. For non-sports fans or people who don't know about sponsorships and how they work in professional sports, I think Air is still a movie for you because it never showcases any actual Basketball (other than on a television) and the inner workings of this company is just interesting in general. Air is now playing in theatres and I think many people will enjoy it. I absolutely recommend this one.","12 April 2023","9/10",NA

Too much can never be said about Ben Affleck as a director. He's one of the best working right now. As solid a movie as you will ever watch.","18 May 2023","9/10",NA
"Air (I) (2023)","Absolutely NOT a sports fan, but really liked this movie","thejdrage","I actually rated it at 7.5 stars. Ben Affleck's acting wasn't as good as we know it could have been. The strain of being on both sides of the camera showed - but damn he was great as a director!! Also felt that Chris Tucker's usual comedy set him apart for such a strong part.So, I am absolutely NOT a sports fan and I don't wear Air Jordan shoes. HOWEVER, it was fun to see that Peter Moore, the original creator of the shoe, did, indeed, make them a work of art from the very beginning - once he was given free reign. That made me the happiest!! I DO love looking at Air Jordan's and they are absolutely BEAUTIFUL!This movie about sports and sport clothes was brilliantly done due to the fact that everyone in it felt free to be very natural.Some reviewers don't like that we never see Michael Jordan's face. I did like it. He is FAR too well-known to be played by an actor. AND this movie really wan't about him, per se. It was very much about his mother and what she did not only for him, but for everyone in sports.This is a movie for everyone. ENJOY!!","29 March 2023","8/10",NA
"Air (I) (2023)","Can Ben Affleck and Matt Damon always make movies together","burntoutboy","I managed to watch this at an early screening and I was pleasantly surprised.Of course most people know Michael Jordan and how he arguably is the best basketball player of all time and potentially best athlete of all time. But I bet a fair few people don't know the behind the doors story of how the most popular sneaker came into creation. This is where Air comes in.Right from the very start, the movie brings you along for the journey, engaging at every possible moment instead of just telling it to your face. The script was really well written to achieve this.The acting was too notch, particularly from Damon and Davis. At times you forget they are portraying real people.It was surprisingly funny at times and whilst you know the end of the story, the movie still gets you routing for everything to work out.For me, this is the first Oscar worthy film of the year (primarily for acting and screenplay) but credit should also be given to Afflecks direction. Just like Argo, he's got another directorial hit and his hands.","5 April 2023","9/10",NA
"Air (I) (2023)","So damn good!","UniqueParticle","Ben Affleck directed and co-starred in this so well; Alex Convery wrote it with glorious talent! For someone that doesn't really keep up much with sports this was enthralling, very informative, and quite entertaining. I loved Air I can't praise enough I had a lot of fun. The comedy was better than expected especially everything with Chris Messina and Matt Damon bantering. I wasn't sure why Micheal Jordan barely had lines at all even though the movie had a lot to do with him even that was crafty, the bulk is about Nike corporation which was all great. I hope the ratings/reviews get plenty of praise even awards.","7 April 2023","9/10",NA
"Air (I) (2023)","Surprisingly entertaining biopic about the rise of a sports brand","trevorwomble","Nike are now synonymous with sports and sportswear, and Adidas's great rivals, however it wasn't always that way and this little film explains how they did it.This film started off as a made for streaming movie, small(ish) in scale and with a decent but not spectacular budget. However the casting of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (both in front of and behind the camera) really brought it up to another level. Whilst the final result still feels like a glorified TV movie, Damon is excellent as usual and for once Affleck doesn't seem to be punching above his weight as an actor. This is actually a very well made and acted film, although the slight story may not be to everyone's taste.Viola Davis and Julius Tannon also turn in a good performances as Michael Jordan's devoted parents. There are also solid turns from Chris Tucker (looking a few pounds heavier than the last time I saw him in anything worthwhile) and Jason Bateman amongst others.It's an interesting subject matter and I enjoyed the soundtrack too (many 80s songs of my youth) although it does have a lot of swearing so may not be appropriate for all. Ben Affleck is a very capable director and this is another good movie from him. If you enjoyed more recent biopic films like 'The Founder' and 'Steve Jobs' then you should enjoy this.","7 April 2023","8/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (Part One) boasts some of cinema's most stunning stunt work, but it came at the cost of character development and a solid story.","Paragon240","Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.","18 July 2023","7/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","Very disappointing","ragingbull_2005","After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.","15 July 2023","5/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","A Mindless Scour to the Series","JackRJosie","Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.","12 July 2023","6/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","Your high expectations will get a beating...","imseeg","4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me. THAT has never happened to me before watching a MI movie!Despite this disappointing conclusion I still wanna thank you for reading my 2001 th review on Imdb.","11 July 2023","5/10",NA

The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!","18 July 2023","5/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","One clever action sequence - after two and a half hours - does not make a good movie.","210west","Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.","8 July 2023","4/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","Tom Cruise just gets it...","jackreinbott","Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.","10 July 2023","9/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","Best franchise currently going","masonsaul","Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect. Baffling.","19 July 2023","10/10",NA

It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.","8 July 2023","4/10",NA

That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning (Part One) boasts some of cinema's most stunning stunt work, but it came at the cost of character development and a solid story.","Paragon240","Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.","18 July 2023","7/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","Very disappointing","ragingbull_2005","After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.","15 July 2023","5/10",NA

There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","One clever action sequence - after two and a half hours - does not make a good movie.","210west","Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.","8 July 2023","4/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","Tom Cruise just gets it...","jackreinbott","Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.","10 July 2023","9/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","Best franchise currently going","masonsaul","Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect. Baffling.","19 July 2023","10/10",NA

Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.","8 July 2023","4/10",NA

As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture.

That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me. THAT has never happened to me before watching a MI movie!Despite this disappointing conclusion I still wanna thank you for reading my 2001 th review on Imdb.","11 July 2023","5/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","Dead stupid.","BA_Harrison","Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!","18 July 2023","5/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","One clever action sequence - after two and a half hours - does not make a good movie.","210west","Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.","8 July 2023","4/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","Tom Cruise just gets it...","jackreinbott","Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.","10 July 2023","9/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","Best franchise currently going","masonsaul","Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect. Baffling.","19 July 2023","10/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","Grace's Mission.","jamericanbeauty","Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.","8 July 2023","4/10",NA
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)","Tom still The King","MFC9","This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!","11 July 2023","9/10",NA

"Murdercise (2023)","Get ready for drugs, sex, and big hair. A true delight.","shagee7977","Just watched Paul Ragsdale and Angelica De Alba's latest movie MURDERCISE and we absolutely loved it. As longtime fans of Paul and Angie's movies, we've seen the progression of their work from Cinco de Mayo through Streets of Vengeance and Slashlorette Party. With every project they refine their art and the movies just keep getting better and better.Murdercise is a call back to 80s horror movies like Death Spa and Killer Workout, and Paul and Angie absolutely nailed the 80s aesthetic. Having lived through the 80s myself, I can attest the score, costumes and sets are perfect. If you're a fan of 80s horror, you're going to love this movie.Murdercise has incredible production value for a crowdfunded indie horror. It looks and sounds great, with a fantastic soundtrack and quality sound mixing. Two things can quickly kill a low budget movie, poor lighting and bad audio. Murdercise shines in both areas, it's well lit and it sounds great.The script is another way in which Murdercise shines. Many indie horror movies have awesome practical effects and cool kills, but weak dialogue. The dialogue in Murdercise is smart and funny. Indie darling Kansas Bowling's (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Psycho Ape) character has some hilarious dialogue and Kansas plays the part perfectly. I laughed out loud at several of her lines. She is GREAT in this movie. Jessa Daisy, Drew Marvick and Nina Lanee Kent are also fantastic in their roles. Jessa has a scene that had us in tears from laughing. The entire movie is really well cast and well acted, Paul and Angie really know how to get the best out of their actors and the result is a quality production. Oh and I would be remiss if I didn't mention that most of the cast of Murdercise look like they're straight out of a modeling agency.Clocking in at just under 90 minutes, Murdercise is well paced and never drags, it's an easy fun watch. It took us longer than 90 minutes to watch it, however, because some of the scenes were so funny we kept rewinding and watching again.

It's like a well-crafted poem, not a word wasted, not a moment lost. It moves, it grooves, it never drags, never lags.

"Murdercise (2023)","Get ready for drugs, sex, and big hair. A true delight.","shagee7977","Just watched Paul Ragsdale and Angelica De Alba's latest movie MURDERCISE and we absolutely loved it. As longtime fans of Paul and Angie's movies, we've seen the progression of their work from Cinco de Mayo through Streets of Vengeance and Slashlorette Party. With every project they refine their art and the movies just keep getting better and better.Murdercise is a call back to 80s horror movies like Death Spa and Killer Workout, and Paul and Angie absolutely nailed the 80s aesthetic. Having lived through the 80s myself, I can attest the score, costumes and sets are perfect. If you're a fan of 80s horror, you're going to love this movie.Murdercise has incredible production value for a crowdfunded indie horror. It looks and sounds great, with a fantastic soundtrack and quality sound mixing. Two things can quickly kill a low budget movie, poor lighting and bad audio. Murdercise shines in both areas, it's well lit and it sounds great.The script is another way in which Murdercise shines. Many indie horror movies have awesome practical effects and cool kills, but weak dialogue. The dialogue in Murdercise is smart and funny. Indie darling Kansas Bowling's (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Psycho Ape) character has some hilarious dialogue and Kansas plays the part perfectly. I laughed out loud at several of her lines. She is GREAT in this movie. Jessa Daisy, Drew Marvick and Nina Lanee Kent are also fantastic in their roles. Jessa has a scene that had us in tears from laughing. The entire movie is really well cast and well acted, Paul and Angie really know how to get the best out of their actors and the result is a quality production. Oh and I would be remiss if I didn't mention that most of the cast of Murdercise look like they're straight out of a modeling agency.Clocking in at just under 90 minutes, Murdercise is well paced and never drags, it's an easy fun watch. It took us longer than 90 minutes to watch it, however, because some of the scenes were so funny we kept rewinding and watching again. Congrats to everyone involved, this is a movie people are really going to enjoy.","25 August 2023","10/10",NA

Unable to endure the mistreatment any longer, she embarks on a murderous spree with guidance from Isabella, played by Nina Lanee Kent, an insane mafia princess who serves as a mentor. The film effectively captures the feel and style of the 80s, complete with practical effects and plenty of blood and excitement. Kansas Bowling delivers a standout performance, showcasing her talent as a gifted actress, followed by the humorous Drew Maverick and iconic actress Ginger Lynn. Murdercise pays meticulous attention to the costumes, hairdos, and sets of that era, with drugs, sex, and big hair playing prominent roles. Directors Angelica De Alba and Paul Ragsdale successfully blend blood, humor, and a lot of 1980s pop culture once again.","31 August 2023","3/10",NA
"Murdercise (2023)","An absolute dumpster fire of a rubbish movie...","paul_haakonsen","I thought we stopped making nonsense like this in the eighties.Murdercise seems to have been made in backlots and unused offices by wannabe porn stars playing dress up and pretend.Everything, and I do mean everything is awful.The acting, awful. The direction, awful. The plot, awful. It seems very much like a film made during covid and that is not a compliment.I usually don't like to give one star ratings to movies anymore because it takes a lot of effort to get an indie film made these days. But in this case, I will make an exception. It has a depressingly cheap and sleazy feel to the whole thing.","10 July 2023","1/10",NA
"Murdercise (2023)","Get ready for drugs, sex, and big hair. A true delight.","shagee7977","Just watched Paul Ragsdale and Angelica De Alba's latest movie MURDERCISE and we absolutely loved it. As longtime fans of Paul and Angie's movies, we've seen the progression of their work from Cinco de Mayo through Streets of Vengeance and Slashlorette Party. With every project they refine their art and the movies just keep getting better and better.Murdercise is a call back to 80s horror movies like Death Spa and Killer Workout, and Paul and Angie absolutely nailed the 80s aesthetic. Having lived through the 80s myself, I can attest the score, costumes and sets are perfect. If you're a fan of 80s horror, you're going to love this movie.Murdercise has incredible production value for a crowdfunded indie horror. It looks and sounds great, with a fantastic soundtrack and quality sound mixing. Two things can quickly kill a low budget movie, poor lighting and bad audio. Murdercise shines in both areas, it's well lit and it sounds great.The script is another way in which Murdercise shines. Many indie horror movies have awesome practical effects and cool kills, but weak dialogue. The dialogue in Murdercise is smart and funny. Indie darling Kansas Bowling's (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Psycho Ape) character has some hilarious dialogue and Kansas plays the part perfectly. I laughed out loud at several of her lines. She is GREAT in this movie. Jessa Daisy, Drew Marvick and Nina Lanee Kent are also fantastic in their roles. Jessa has a scene that had us in tears from laughing. The entire movie is really well cast and well acted, Paul and Angie really know how to get the best out of their actors and the result is a quality production. Oh and I would be remiss if I didn't mention that most of the cast of Murdercise look like they're straight out of a modeling agency.Clocking in at just under 90 minutes, Murdercise is well paced and never drags, it's an easy fun watch. It took us longer than 90 minutes to watch it, however, because some of the scenes were so funny we kept rewinding and watching again. Congrats to everyone involved, this is a movie people are really going to enjoy.","25 August 2023","10/10",NA
"Murdercise (2023)","Objectively terrible","stevelivesey67","Yeah so it's not gonna ever go mainstream...so YAY!!! A fun movie made by independent art makers. A fun watch and made with love. Big fan and thoroughly enjoyed this whole thing! Yay A&P Films for keeping indie art alive. I ordered the DVD and seriously enjoyed it. I encourage at least a watch. Indie art doesn't cost 100 million dollars and it shouldn't. ITS funny and sexy and was made to entertain indie fans. Gorgeous people in this...all the exercise ladies and drew maverick and Josh parks made me cheer extra. I wish this played in my area so happy to have gotten to get the DVD. Seriously...in the vein of troma ...this is epic.","4 October 2023","1/10",NA
"Murdercise (2023)","Perverts, Strippers, and Communists","nogodnomasters","...of course, you may well be doing ""bad things"" whilst watching and you know what - it does what it says on the label, this film ""meets expectations"".It's fun, stupid fun - with ""hot"" women, blood and gore.Troma-adjacent, brain-dead fun. A stoner movie, so I decided to go with that vibe and that may have lead to my 8/10. It does what I love about horror - a bunch of people that love the genre and look like they're having fun doing it.Yeah, the acting's pretty bad, but if you lean into that this is a blast and it's part of the charm. What did surprise me (nicely) was the script seems quite sharp and there's some genuinely witty dialogue - this is genuinely funnier and better than the last 3 (or more) Marvel films.It also gets an extra bonus point for having some dude that looks like Steve Digiorgio in it, but then gets that point subtracted for no bass solo ;)","10 July 2023","2/10",NA
"Murdercise (2023)","KILLER BODIES, KILLER LAUGHS, KILLER MOVIE","skinnerramone","I'm Facebook friends with the director, Paul Ragsdale. This has no effect on my review. I was a child of the 80s and I watched horror films the whole time, and I quickly embraced slashers. As an adult, I'm a full-blown slasher addict/nerd. I'll take any slasher I can get. What 'Paul Ragsdale' told me once was that he loves making horror movies that remind him of the 80s, and I admire that. 'Murdercise' is a complete throwback to 80s cheesy slashers. It's a comedy too, with decent acting. Nobody was wrongly cast. If you love 80s slashers, I highly recommend. It's a love letter to 80s slashers.👍","16 September 2023","9/10",NA
"Murdercise (2023)","Great indie gold!","christinemartin891","Ah, man, the flick they call ""Murdercise,"" it's a wild ride, a real trip, a journey into the heart of hilarity and horror, all wrapped up in one. I found myself caught in the rhythm of it, the beat of the dialogue, the pulse of the laughter. It's a thing of beauty, man, a thing of beauty.You see, some of those indie horror films out there, they're like a jazz solo gone wrong, all over the place, missing the beat, losing the groove. They try to make up for it with the spectacle of effects, the thrill of the kill, but it's like putting a band-aid on a broken saxophone. It just doesn't sing, man.But ""Murdercise,"" oh, it sings. It's got that rhythm, that flow, that dialogue that dances and twirls like a couple lost in love on a moonlit night. It's hilarious, man, a real knee-slapper, a belly laugh that comes from deep within the soul.And the runtime, just under 90 minutes, it's perfect, man, just perfect. It's like a well-crafted poem, not a word wasted, not a moment lost. It moves, it grooves, it never drags, never lags. It's a ride that keeps on rolling, keeps on moving, keeps on grooving.Kansas Bowling, she's a star, a real shining light. Her character is a laugh, a hoot, a real funny bone tickler. She nails it, man, nails it like a hammer hitting a nail right on the head. It's a performance to remember, a performance to savor.And Jessa Daisy, oh, she's got a scene, man, a scene that'll make you laugh till you cry, laugh till you're out of breath. She's perfect in it, just perfect. And Drew Mavrick, he's right there with her, laughing and joking and making you laugh right along with him.""Murdercise,"" it's a film that's got it all, man. It's got the laughs, it's got the thrills, it's got the chills. It's a wild ride, a wild journey, a wild trip into the heart of what makes us laugh, what makes us feel, what makes us human.So take the ride, man, take the trip. Dive into the world of ""Murdercise"" and let it take you away, let it sweep you off your feet, let it make you laugh like you've never laughed before. It's a film to remember, a film to cherish, a film to love. It's ""Murdercise,"" man, and it's a real trip.","1 January 2024","4/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","A few words of warning for those with high expectations...","imseeg","Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10.","3 December 2023","6/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","An interesting failure","petra_ste","Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked.","25 November 2023","6/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","My biggest disappointment this year","MissSimonetta","Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well.

"Napoleon (2023)","Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical.","dhunjiwadia","What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing. I liked only two elements of this movie: musical score and costumes.","26 November 2023","5/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","Awful.","krzysiektom","I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not.","2 December 2023","2/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","Knew it was Bad. Even so, Surprised at HOW bad.","levybob","The success of any film depends mostly on the script. Why Scott would initiate such an expensive project without ensuring a refined and sophisticated script is a mystery. I'm not convinced there is a single interesting scene that provides insight into the characters or captures through language the prevailing political ideas. Scott's frequent missteps as a director reflect a greater interest in the cinematic rather than in the dramatic. However, this seems inevitable when your priority is delivering a blockbuster that will have broad appeal instead of digging deeper into culture, society, or history. A colossal waste of an extraordinary opportunity to create an important film about a fascinating historical figure.","2 March 2024","4/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","Images without Words","Eleatic67","NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers.","22 November 2023","6/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","Expected an experience ... almost fell asleep","Vic_max","Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better.","23 November 2023","6/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","Tired of Romanticized and incorrect Historical movies","epicking","Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut.","23 November 2023","3/10",NA

But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris.","23 November 2023","4/10",NA

We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not.","2 December 2023","2/10",NA

"Napoleon (2023)","Images without Words","Eleatic67","NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills. This film was a huge disappointment and I felt embarrassed for the filmmakers.","22 November 2023","6/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","Expected an experience ... almost fell asleep","Vic_max","Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better.","23 November 2023","6/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","Tired of Romanticized and incorrect Historical movies","epicking","Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there.

"Napoleon (2023)","A few words of warning for those with high expectations...","imseeg","Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10.","3 December 2023","6/10",NA

His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not.","2 December 2023","2/10",NA

"Napoleon (2023)","Images without Words","Eleatic67","NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills.

"Napoleon (2023)","Expected an experience ... almost fell asleep","Vic_max","Yes, that's a real quote from Joaquin Phoenix to Ridley Scott right before they started filming. I love Joaquin Phoenix, but you can really tell that he doesn't ""get"" the character of Napoleon that he's trying to play. I honestly don't know if Phoenix even has that kind of charisma and confidence within him, but then again I don't know anything about Napoleon either. But it was just uncomfortable watching him stumble his way through the movie, often just looking clueless.The other problem with the movie is it's just plain dull and uninteresting. It really does feel like a ""highlights"" movie. For an almost 3-hour film, it has surprisingly little dialogue. The dialogue that's there isn't' that illuminating or interesting. I normally like politics and romance (which is the bulk of this story), but I would have loved to see more military and war stuff in a movie like this. Isn't Napoleon supposed to be a brilliant war leader? There's like none of that here. Except ""oh we'll do a sneak attack in the night.""The cinematography was also really surprisingly dull. It looked super digital. The colors were so bland and washed out.Vanessa Kirby is really the best thing about the movie. And also the first battle taking over that fort, which was admittedly pretty epic. I have never seen such a thing happen to a horse in a movie, and it was wonderfully horrifying.I fully blame Ridley Scott for this dud. Hopefully Spielberg's Kubrick miniseries about Napoleon will be much better.","23 November 2023","6/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","Tired of Romanticized and incorrect Historical movies","epicking","Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut.","23 November 2023","3/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","BAD, REALLY BAD, TERRIBLY BAD, AND I WILL EXPLAIN","LongTimeMovieLover","History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott's sprawling epic on Napoleon's life.Mr Scott's craftsmanship is such that it's undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don't make up for gross historical approximation.I have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn't, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris.","23 November 2023","4/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","A few words of warning for those with high expectations...","imseeg","Ridley Scott directed one of the best movies ever made set during the Napoleonic Wars: unfortunately, that movie is not Napoleon but his cinematic debut, The Duellists, forty years ago.Unsurprisingly, The Duellists had a strong source material (it was based on a novel by Joseph Conrad which it often followed almost verbatim), while Napoleon has an uneven screenplay by David Scarpa.Even past the age of eighty Sir Ridley can still shoot pretty and energetic pictures but his hits and misses depend on the scripts he picks, and he hasn't always shown the best discernment.The elephant in the room is the large amount of historical inaccuracies. Even as a history buff I can forgive many of those: cutting or simplifying events for the sake of narrative, or even some overdramatization like the meeting between Napoleon and Wellington (it never happened) or Napoleon being present at Marie Antoinette's execution (he wasn't); however, stuff like Napoleon charging with his troops at Waterloo is absolute cringe, a kid's (or a lout's) idea of history.Still, the big problems here are characterization and pacing.The movie is a demythologization (some would say emasculation) of Napoleon. If you want to take this route then fair enough, but the character here fails to be consistent. I can buy a Napoleon who is an egomaniac and an overrated tactician (like in Tolstoy's War and Peace). I do not buy one who is an anxious, insecure, uncharismatic cold fish but also a stern tactical genius and an effective leader of men, one who flees from Egypt because Josephine is unfaithful but is also an unflappable military mastermind.Phoenix is a great actor and does what he can but the two sides of the character just don't gel with each other. You can't have parodic moments like Napoleon rolling down the stairs during his coup against the Directory, despondently pouting as he waits for the rain to stop at Waterloo or awkwardly climbing on a box to stand face to face with a pharaoh's mummy (with his diminutive stature becoming a not-too-subtle metaphor of his overall mediocrity)... AND THEN have him magnetically charm the French soldiers into obedience after the Elba. This gawky Napoleon would have been shot to pieces there.The other problem is pacing. A single movie about the whole life of Napoleon is in itself absurd, like making ""a movie about World War 2"". There is material in Napoleon's life for a VERY dense miniseries (which Steven Spielberg is reportedly planning).Napoleon's first wife Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) plays a huge role here but I would argue the movie has either too little or way too much of her. This needed to be either focused mostly on Napoleon's personal life or to drastically reduce the (fairly repetitive after a while) moments where Napoleon is obsessed with his wife.As it is now, it tries to tell - but rushes through - twenty very eventful years of European history and yet devotes more time to Napoleon visiting Josephine after their divorce than to his Russian campaign.It's like making a D-Day movie which keeps cutting back and forth from the Normandy landings to Hitler spending time with Eva Braun. You can have either The Longest Day or Der Untergang, not both.Still, it's not worthless. There are some interesting moments and set-pieces and, while Phoenix is saddled with a contradictory character, Kirby at least is excellent.6/10.","3 December 2023","6/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","An interesting failure","petra_ste","Ridley Scott's NAPOLEON feels like the highlight reel of a lengthy miniseries. Considering there's a 4-hour cut of this film, that explains it all.NAPOLEON is certainly good spectacle. The battle scenes are breathtaking. Unfortunately, it's also shallow. I know Scott has sneered at viewers criticizing the historical inaccuracies in the film, but I'm more bothered by a total lack of interesting character psychology or even coherent storytelling. Characters pop in and out, leaving little impression in their brief scenes. Relationships between characters are barely fleshed out, including that of Napoleon and Josephine, which dominates the running time. Also, potentially unpopular opinion, I thought Joaquin Phoenix's performance was a one-note bore.Perhaps the 4-hour version is a richer piece of work. As is, NAPOLEON is a let down, especially after Scott's brilliant 2021 period piece THE LAST DUEL, which had all the drama and psychological depth this movie lacked.","25 November 2023","6/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","My biggest disappointment this year","MissSimonetta","Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical. History is like an uninvited guest in this movie. Stunning battle visuals don't make up for gross historical approximations.If you want to watch a masterpiece then see Waterloo, with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. And if you want a historical enumeration then watch the Napoleon series with Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossalini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu.This movie was made for Apple streaming. Then they made a butchered version for cinema to be able to compete for the Oscars. The original Apple streaming version will be at least 2 hours longer. This cut version for cinema is somewhat rushed, disjointed and, as a result, confusing.We never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful and won the admiration of so many. Here it's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in reality, over here he's shown as a childish brute. The focus was more on set pieces and his relationship with Josephine.Joaquin Phoenix can play odd or troubled characters well. Here he barely succeeds in persuading the viewers that he is Napoleon. He's too old for this role (Napoleon was 24 when Marie Antoinette was guillotined) and made the character seem bizarre than a charismatic leader. Vanessa Kirby as Josephine gets more traction.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is of a very high order. The battle scenes are filmed well. Ridley Scott knows how to make action scenes slick and impressive. But overall it's a below average movie. Napoleon deserves better than this shambolic movie.","26 November 2023","2/10",NA
"Napoleon (2023)","Ridley Scott's Napoleon is more hysterical than historical.","dhunjiwadia","What a disappointment. This film is BORING. A movie with a huge budget, good actors, about a person as fascinating and complex as Bonaparte, who participated in more than 60 battles and had drama, triumphs and failures that would be enough for a few lifetimes, is... BORING! Nothing is well explained, it's unclear who is who beside Napoleon and Josephine. Several unnecessary sex scenes between the two. What's even worse is that it's unclear why the French nation would follow and worship this Napoleon as he's portrayed in this movie, because in this movie he seems a mediocre personality, without much charisma or extraordinary abilities. In addition, everything on the screen looks greyish blue, without vivid colors, and it is a bit depressing.

"Napoleon (2023)","Awful.","krzysiektom","I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix.

The story, characters and villain are all a step up. It's intense and suspenseful throughout.But of course, we're here for the action. And just like the rest of the movie, it jumps a level. It's just as clear and well-shot as in the original. But it's more creative, bigger and harder. It has one of the coolest, longest and most impressive simulated one-takes I've ever seen. I was mesmerized.The only criticism I have is that it's anticlimactic. The best action scene happens early, second best happens in the middle, and the last action scene is the smallest (but still good). Other than that, I loved this movie.As someone who constantly trashes the inferior quality of Netflix original movies, I have to give them credit here. And as a huge fan of fight scenes and action movies, I'm ecstatic at the new levels I've seen from franchises like this and John Wick.

But you can't get angry at people finding them instantly forgettable. There's no true emotional depth to them, try as they may.It is worth noting that there is an incredible ""single-take"" scene early in this film that was done phenomenally well. The work that must've gone into pulling it off, I can't even imagine. It's the highlight of the movie by a comfortable margin. The only problem I find with these scenes is that it takes me about 6 minutes to click onto the fact I'm watching a ""single-take"".The film has a decent villain and the pacing is pretty good.

I was in total awe; I couldn't avoid smiling. You will not witness much better stunts and choreography (it is arguably better than that of the John Wick trilogy).What's most impressive is the camerawork. There is a 20-minute sequence without any visible cuts that is so immersive. You will be blown away by the impressive technological achievement this crew has achieved. I could hardly believe what I was watching; helicopters landing on moving trains and cameras going in and out of windows have never been easier to follow. This is not a gimmick; it's a highly efficient tool used to make the movie highly intriguing.The rest of the movie does sadly not live up to what the first act had to offer. It goes from an action masterpiece to another generic action-thriller by Netflix. It should honestly have ended after 50 minutes. There is no way you could top what we've just seen. The story doesn't justify the action. They are fighting -- but why? They go back and forth between each other, and at one point it gets tiresome. Just finish it up already.Overall, a movie worth your time with some spectacular action. Don't go into this expecting a movie with substance, but rather an entertaining movie.

" Extraction II (2023)","Had me until Vienna","MattD12027","One of the bigger Netflix original hits over the previous few years, 2020's Extraction provided the streaming bigwig with a new franchise starter in the form of Chris Hemsworth's rough as guts Aussie black market mercenary for hire Tyler Rake and without attempting to reinvent the wheel in any way, shape or form 3 years on, we now have Extraction 2.The type of safe sequel that is going to ensure anyone that had a great time with Tyler first time around running and gunning through Bangladesh is going to have a repeat experience this go around, while anyone that found the Hemsworth lead action thriller nothing more than mindlessly acceptable are highly unlikely to be converted by this experience, Extraction 2 dishes up the same high body count thrill ride meal this go around in what amounts to another film with some seriously impressive action beats but a an equally undercooked and raw set of characters/story arcs.Highlighted by what is likely to remain one of if not the best 2023 action sequences that sees Rake take part in an extensive one take sequence that features prison riots, helicopter chases and more hand to hand combat than a Raid double bill, when Extraction 2's significantly impressive action set-ups are underway it's operating at an elite level but despite all the wizardry in this department that director Sam Hargrave and his team conjure up, there's a lot of lameness present in Extraction 2 elsewhere that anchors it down in a big way.Wasting precious little time on getting over the fact Rake was last seen knocking on deaths door in the first outing, Hargrave and his leading man get Rake and his crack team that includes Golshifteh Farahani's and Adam Bessa's Nik and Yaz Khan moving at a rapid pace to transport us to the country of Georgia, where Rake's next extraction mission is located and where we meet our collection of cookie cutter side characters that includes your new candidate for most annoying movie person of the year, Andro Japaridze's Sandro Radiani.Seemingly developed for no other reason than to progress the films plot beyond that of its core extraction sequence that will get tongues wagging and audiences talking in that buzzy way needed for direct to streaming films to stand out from the crowd, Sandro is a bastion as to why Extraction 2 can never break free and become the new age action classic it potentially might have been with questionable scripting, characters and narrative decisions all working against a film that puts all of its best eggs in one early basket and never really gets close to delivering to the same level the next hour or so following.With a third Extraction already proudly announced by Netflix and the creative team behind the Rake feature film universe, this Chris Hemsworth and Russ Brothers backed property still has a chance to prove its worthy of being considered alongside the greats of the action thriller genre but at this stage its still nothing more than an impressively staged experience with little too no heart and soul.Final Say -We may get to know a little more about Tyler Rake this time around but despite a noteworthy extended action sequence, Extraction 2 is another cold movie going experience that feels like a little brother to the kings of the genre it wants to conquer.2 1/2 AFL broadcasts out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","20 June 2023","4/10",NA

But partly this feels like watching a shot-them-up game with the same mindless go from point A to point B, do the thing, kill everyone, then go from B to C, do the thing, kill everyone. Repeat. With the sudden but inevitable betrayal. And if you look at this movie from that perspective it is meh at best, a really dumb B-movie at worst.The acting is solid, albeit nothing special. The effects are okay for the budget, and the action is more than passable. Sound design, sets and the rest are as good as one can expect from a Netflix movie. Directing is pretty good, probably what mainly save this, together with solid acting, from being too trashy.The story is very simplistic though, and the characters are pretty basic people.

" Extraction II (2023)","Undoubtedly a Remarkable Action Film","albertval-69560","Every once in a while, you come across a movie like ""Extraction"" that not only exceeds your expectations, but takes you on a satisfying, heart-pounding thrill-ride. Then you hope they make a sequel. Then you are elated to discover that a sequel has been greenlit and put into production. Then there is the apprehension on whether or not it will live up to the expectations of the predecessor. Then, ""Extraction 2"" is released, and let me assure you that any doubts or fears of whether this sequel can hold a candle to the original are quickly extinguished. This action-packed, high-octane follow-up not only reaches the heights of the original, it blows it out of the water.Grab your drinks and snacks, switch off all mobile devices and make sure your seatbacks are secured in the upright position, as this film will have you on the edge of your seat!The film opens with a brief rollback of the previous film with Rake, dying of his injuries, taking a reverse swan dive off a motor bridge in Bangladesh. Then after a period of time convalescing, is put back into what Rake does best...extracting! His mission is to extract the wife and children out from a maximum security Georgian prison from under the nose of a powerful imprisoned gangster. What ensues is a kinetic, explosive rollercoaster ride on planes, trains, automobiles, elevators, choppers, all with spent shell casings trailing.The hand-to-hand combat in this flick is brutally entertaining. The weaponry would make any gun enthusiast salivate. The car-chase sequences are nothing short of spectacular. The cinematography is absolutely jaw-dropping, and moments of Hemsworth's dry Aussie humour and charm will want to make anyone want to visit the land down under!A big shout out to the dynamite Golshifteh Farahani and the slick Adam Bessa for reprising the roles of sibling team, Nik and Yaz. The chemistry between Farahani and Bessa with Hemsworth really shines through, and have audiences truly invested in their characters. A salute to director Sam Hargrave for another hard-hitting action flick and a big thanks for the ""Thor"" easter egg!What makes this film great is that it has steered clear away from identity politics, meeting minority quotas, and trying to indoctrinate an audience with ideologies. The story itself may be thin, but sure as hell makes up for it in entertainment. Extraction 2 harkens back to a time where movies were made to entertain, and to allow the audience to take from it a great story, a thrill, catharsis, or be simply lost for words apart from ""Wow!""

You will not witness much better stunts and choreography (it is arguably better than that of the John Wick trilogy).What's most impressive is the camerawork. There is a 20-minute sequence without any visible cuts that is so immersive. You will be blown away by the impressive technological achievement this crew has achieved. I could hardly believe what I was watching; helicopters landing on moving trains and cameras going in and out of windows have never been easier to follow. This is not a gimmick; it's a highly efficient tool used to make the movie highly intriguing.The rest of the movie does sadly not live up to what the first act had to offer. It goes from an action masterpiece to another generic action-thriller by Netflix. It should honestly have ended after 50 minutes. There is no way you could top what we've just seen. The story doesn't justify the action. They are fighting -- but why? They go back and forth between each other, and at one point it gets tiresome. Just finish it up already.Overall, a movie worth your time with some spectacular action. Don't go into this expecting a movie with substance, but rather an entertaining movie.

" Extraction II (2023)","Undoubtedly a Remarkable Action Film","albertval-69560","Every once in a while, you come across a movie like ""Extraction"" that not only exceeds your expectations, but takes you on a satisfying, heart-pounding thrill-ride. Then you hope they make a sequel. Then you are elated to discover that a sequel has been greenlit and put into production. Then there is the apprehension on whether or not it will live up to the expectations of the predecessor. Then, ""Extraction 2"" is released, and let me assure you that any doubts or fears of whether this sequel can hold a candle to the original are quickly extinguished. This action-packed, high-octane follow-up not only reaches the heights of the original, it blows it out of the water.Grab your drinks and snacks, switch off all mobile devices and make sure your seatbacks are secured in the upright position, as this film will have you on the edge of your seat!The film opens with a brief rollback of the previous film with Rake, dying of his injuries, taking a reverse swan dive off a motor bridge in Bangladesh. Then after a period of time convalescing, is put back into what Rake does best...extracting! His mission is to extract the wife and children out from a maximum security Georgian prison from under the nose of a powerful imprisoned gangster. What ensues is a kinetic, explosive rollercoaster ride on planes, trains, automobiles, elevators, choppers, all with spent shell casings trailing.The hand-to-hand combat in this flick is brutally entertaining. The weaponry would make any gun enthusiast salivate. The car-chase sequences are nothing short of spectacular. The cinematography is absolutely jaw-dropping, and moments of Hemsworth's dry Aussie humour and charm will want to make anyone want to visit the land down under!A big shout out to the dynamite Golshifteh Farahani and the slick Adam Bessa for reprising the roles of sibling team, Nik and Yaz. The chemistry between Farahani and Bessa with Hemsworth really shines through, and have audiences truly invested in their characters. A salute to director Sam Hargrave for another hard-hitting action flick and a big thanks for the ""Thor"" easter egg!What makes this film great is that it has steered clear away from identity politics, meeting minority quotas, and trying to indoctrinate an audience with ideologies. The story itself may be thin, but sure as hell makes up for it in entertainment. Extraction 2 harkens back to a time where movies were made to entertain, and to allow the audience to take from it a great story, a thrill, catharsis, or be simply lost for words apart from ""Wow!""

Major props once again to director Sam Hargrave for the directing and action choreography that was flawless.

Say you have 2 hours until a dinner you're looking forward to and you want the time to pass quickly, you put on 'Extraction 2' and before you know it it's time for dinner. You then proceed to never think about the film again for the rest of your life, because there is absolutely nothing memorable about it. There's no problem with these types of movies, we need them. But you can't get angry at people finding them instantly forgettable. There's no true emotional depth to them, try as they may.It is worth noting that there is an incredible ""single-take"" scene early in this film that was done phenomenally well. The work that must've gone into pulling it off, I can't even imagine. It's the highlight of the movie by a comfortable margin. The only problem I find with these scenes is that it takes me about 6 minutes to click onto the fact I'm watching a ""single-take"".The film has a decent villain and the pacing is pretty good.

I was in total awe; I couldn't avoid smiling. You will not witness much better stunts and choreography (it is arguably better than that of the John Wick trilogy).What's most impressive is the camerawork. There is a 20-minute sequence without any visible cuts that is so immersive. You will be blown away by the impressive technological achievement this crew has achieved. I could hardly believe what I was watching; helicopters landing on moving trains and cameras going in and out of windows have never been easier to follow. This is not a gimmick; it's a highly efficient tool used to make the movie highly intriguing.The rest of the movie does sadly not live up to what the first act had to offer. It goes from an action masterpiece to another generic action-thriller by Netflix. It should honestly have ended after 50 minutes. There is no way you could top what we've just seen. The story doesn't justify the action. They are fighting -- but why? They go back and forth between each other, and at one point it gets tiresome. Just finish it up already.Overall, a movie worth your time with some spectacular action. Don't go into this expecting a movie with substance, but rather an entertaining movie. Can't a movie be nothing more than entertaining at times? Sometimes that's enough. Good writing is however important to make the breathtaking action mean something.","21 June 2023","6/10",NA

The whole story about Chris Hemsworth saving a mother and her 2 children is terrible, up to a level that I simply had to skip these ridiculous talking scenes, that only held up the action.Definitely not great as a whole, but worth one watch for (some of) the action spectacle scenes.","17 June 2023","8/10",NA
" Extraction II (2023)","Credibility near ZERO. Action photography is sometimes really impressive though. Mixed bag.","imseeg","A top-rank film in its genre. Amazing action sequences and first-rate production values. Simply a great action film with a couple of sobering moments, the hallmark of an unforgettable action flick.The locations are excellent, too. Much of the film takes place in Donauplatte near the famous Danube River. The action scenes in a high-rise building in this area are incredible. The producers (among them, Chris Hemsworth, himself) didn't spare anything to make the scenes incredibly realistic--such death, destruction and mayhem in just one locale.There's this scene early on where Tyler has hied away in the woods recovering from his injuries. He splits firewood then throws the ax hitting the trunk of a tree spot on from a distance. Shades of Mighty Thor hurling his impervious hammer at the galactic enemy.Great cast; remarkable performances from Hemsworth, Iran-born Golshifteh Farahani, Adam Bessa and Tornike Gogrichiani. Hemsworth is different from other action stars because of the depth of his sensitivity. Something that reminds you of Pierce Brosnan.It's also a reunion of sorts for Hemsworth
and Idris Elba, the guardian of Asgard. Watch out for the well-known actor in a cameo role.There's definitely going to be a Part 3 if you believe in Elba's character.","16 June 2023","5/10",NA
" Extraction II (2023)","Undoubtedly a Remarkable Action Film","albertval-69560","Every once in a while, you come across a movie like ""Extraction"" that not only exceeds your expectations, but takes you on a satisfying, heart-pounding thrill-ride. Then you hope they make a sequel. Then you are elated to discover that a sequel has been greenlit and put into production. Then there is the apprehension on whether or not it will live up to the expectations of the predecessor. Then, ""Extraction 2"" is released, and let me assure you that any doubts or fears of whether this sequel can hold a candle to the original are quickly extinguished. This action-packed, high-octane follow-up not only reaches the heights of the original, it blows it out of the water.Grab your drinks and snacks, switch off all mobile devices and make sure your seatbacks are secured in the upright position, as this film will have you on the edge of your seat!The film opens with a brief rollback of the previous film with Rake, dying of his injuries, taking a reverse swan dive off a motor bridge in Bangladesh. Then after a period of time convalescing, is put back into what Rake does best...extracting! His mission is to extract the wife and children out from a maximum security Georgian prison from under the nose of a powerful imprisoned gangster. What ensues is a kinetic, explosive rollercoaster ride on planes, trains, automobiles, elevators, choppers, all with spent shell casings trailing.The hand-to-hand combat in this flick is brutally entertaining. The weaponry would make any gun enthusiast salivate. The car-chase sequences are nothing short of spectacular. The cinematography is absolutely jaw-dropping, and moments of Hemsworth's dry Aussie humour and charm will want to make anyone want to visit the land down under!A big shout out to the dynamite Golshifteh Farahani and the slick Adam Bessa for reprising the roles of sibling team, Nik and Yaz. The chemistry between Farahani and Bessa with Hemsworth really shines through, and have audiences truly invested in their characters. A salute to director Sam Hargrave for another hard-hitting action flick and a big thanks for the ""Thor"" easter egg!What makes this film great is that it has steered clear away from identity politics, meeting minority quotas, and trying to indoctrinate an audience with ideologies. The story itself may be thin, but sure as hell makes up for it in entertainment. Extraction 2 harkens back to a time where movies were made to entertain, and to allow the audience to take from it a great story, a thrill, catharsis, or be simply lost for words apart from ""Wow!"" Take note, Hollywood. THIS is how movies are to be made. Which begs the question: ""When are they making Extraction 3?""","16 June 2023","9/10",NA
" Extraction II (2023)","Hemsworth, once again...putting the ACTION into EXTRACTION","cmconnexion","Compared to the first film, the story in this one isn't as good, but the action and choreography is top shelf. I'll even say it, it's better than John Wick 4, the difference being that this film has much more realism and is much less monotonous, and Hemsworth looks much better doing it than Keanu Reeves, who looks uncoordinated compared to Hemsworth in this one. Major props once again to director Sam Hargrave for the directing and action choreography that was flawless. Every action sequence looks absolutely authentic and he even threw in some never seen before action tactics. I had always felt that Hemsworth was born to play Thor, but now, he is the new and improved Jason Bourne and John Wick combined. Can't wait for part 3!","18 June 2023","9/10",NA

For me, M3GAN was a blast of entertainment, a perfect concoction of a well-paced story that is just there for you to have fun with. Okay, if I'm honest, it did have some moments that elevated my enjoyment even a little more than I'd hoped--they went to a few places I could not have expected. That doesn't mean that the story wasn't predictable; it was pretty clear where this was going the whole time.

"M3gan (2022)","Toned down to PG-13 so teens can watch","FeastMode","M3gan is another example of a movie that was originally meant to be rated R, absolutely should be rated R, but is toned down to PG-13 so they can sell more tickets. Instead of focusing on making something awesome for real movie fans, something people will talk about for years, they focus on the casuals and teens (there were even a few children at my viewing). I continue to ask, when are studios going to stop being cowards and have the courage to go all out?Unfortunately that's far from the only problem with M3gan. My biggest complaint is it feels like such a tease. Part of the reason is the aforementioned limitations which doesn't allow you to be creative with or even show the kills. The other reason is that this movie takes FOREVER to get going. And every time I think, okay here we go, it steps back and makes me wait longer. It's not a long movie, and I don't have a short attention span. I just wanted it to go crazy and it never really did.Other than that, this is just a mediocre movie. I love a good blend of horror and comedy, but the comedy barely made me laugh, and the horror is barely that. With the exception of a solid performance by the main child, I found the rest of the acting to be serviceable at best.If you're like me and feel like this barely scratched an itch, watch Malignant.

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...","imseeg","""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 October 2023","5/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","MrDHWong","Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.","22 October 2023","9/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers Of The Audience's Bladders","boblipton","Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety. The performances could have been good in a tighter and more focused movie, with De Niro being onto something unique as the ageing, self-righteous patriarch William Hale.","18 November 2023","7/10",NA

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Another excursion in indulgence and overnarration from Scorsese","fredrikgunerius","Obviously this isn't bad. It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest. And it made me much more aware of the length because I kept thinking about how much longer it was going to be. I think they just kept shooting until they ran out of film.","2 January 2024","4/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","tough watch","SnoopyStyle","First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.","29 October 2023","7/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.","22 October 2023","7/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of my patience","Med-Jasta","The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.","19 October 2023","4/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of the Flower Moon","CinemaSerf","I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.","23 October 2023","7/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","What a disappointment","ChrisScreenwriter","Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.","18 October 2023","5/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...","imseeg","""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 October 2023","5/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","MrDHWong","Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.","22 October 2023","9/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers Of The Audience's Bladders","boblipton","Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety.

It's from an amazing director with an interesting story. Now that that's out of the way... This was the worst way to tell this story! It should have been from the POV of the FBI! That's when things got interesting. Telling the story in chronological order wasn't interesting. It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered. In order, random things happen along with a story that didn't deserve that much time.Following Leo wasn't interesting enough to hold two hours by itself. Was it supposed to be heart breaking? Sad? I don't know. But there wasn't enough going on to fill up the plot. The FBI gets in and that team looked so cool. It would have been much more shocking for them to hear about the murders all at once and really driven the point home instead of kinda experiencing it.It was so slow! Too slow! I was worried about 3 1/2 hours, I didn't realize that was going to feel like 6 1/2. The Irishman is a slow movie but it isn't boring. And this movie is boring. It's not just slow, it's boring. I kept waiting for it to get going and it never did. The slow pacing was a disadvantage to the movie because it made me lose interest.

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","tough watch","SnoopyStyle","First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.","29 October 2023","7/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.","22 October 2023","7/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of my patience","Med-Jasta","The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.","19 October 2023","4/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of the Flower Moon","CinemaSerf","I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.","23 October 2023","7/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","What a disappointment","ChrisScreenwriter","Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.","18 October 2023","5/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...","imseeg","""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 October 2023","5/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","MrDHWong","Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.","22 October 2023","9/10",NA

The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end.

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","tough watch","SnoopyStyle","First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.","29 October 2023","7/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.","22 October 2023","7/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of my patience","Med-Jasta","The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.","19 October 2023","4/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of the Flower Moon","CinemaSerf","I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.","23 October 2023","7/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","What a disappointment","ChrisScreenwriter","Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.","18 October 2023","5/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...","imseeg","""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 October 2023","5/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","MrDHWong","Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.","22 October 2023","9/10",NA

For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety.

This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.","29 October 2023","7/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.","22 October 2023","7/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of my patience","Med-Jasta","The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.","19 October 2023","4/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of the Flower Moon","CinemaSerf","I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.","23 October 2023","7/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","What a disappointment","ChrisScreenwriter","Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.","18 October 2023","5/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Not the magnificent masterpiece I was hoping for. Not by far...","imseeg","""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a Western crime drama film co-written and directed by Martin Scorsese, based on the non-fiction book of the same name by David Grann. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, it touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast.In the early 1920s, the discovery of oil on land belonging to the Native American Osage Nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world. This sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the Osage tribe as possible. Among this group of interlopers is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), whom upon arriving in Oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to marry a member of the Osage as a way of inheriting their fortune. Ernest soon falls in love with and later marries Mollie (Lily Gladstone), a young Osage woman who has strong ties to her family's riches. As the white occupation of native land continues, members of the Osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances, with some of Mollie's close family being among the most prominent victims.One of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment, they also function as a great method of preservation. No matter obscure the topic may be, if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream, then it has already been permanently preserved in some way. This is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time, and in doing so, has helped maintain its relevance with the general public. One event that is often glanced over is the Osage Indian murders, a series of slayings of wealthy members of the Native American Osage tribe during the early 20th century. However, thanks to Martin Scorsese's film ""Killers of the Flower Moon"", audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated, eye-opening look at America's treatment of one particular group of their indigenous population.Much like most of Scorsese's best known work, the film is framed as an epic, in-depth study of the dark side of human nature. We watch how the Osage tribe, who live in harmony among themselves, are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land. In spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated, the Osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs. Because of this, the tribe's happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination, first verbal and then physical. It is here we see the sinister plan of William King Hale come into play, where he marries off his nephew Ernest into the Osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right. What makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it. Only a filmmaker like Scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity, and in a style that remains as timeless as ever.Additionally, almost all of Scorsese's visual trademarks as a director are on full display here, from his wide-open cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of 1920s America to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene. One in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between Ernest and William as they discuss business regarding the Osage. We see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe, with Ernest choosing to remain loyal to his Osage wife Mollie, while his uncle William reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place. Here, Scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room. The darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the Osage have created up until this point.Due to the scale of its theme and plotting, the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours (206 minutes in total). This is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters, as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience. While I personally think this made the film more interesting to watch, I'm not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers. The film's pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air, which I believe works rather effectively, and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion. In other words, this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind, something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues. To that effect, Scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other Hollywood blockbusters.In his sixth collaboration with the legendary director, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of Ernest Burkhart. What makes DiCaprio's character so intriguing is his indecisive nature, in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his Osage wife Mollie. On one hand, Ernest's loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncle's idea in the first place, while on the other hand when he truly falls for Mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe. DiCaprio displays his signature range of emotion here, alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncle's bidding, both of which he pulls off quite effectively.After working on ten films together, Robert De Niro steps back from his usual spot as the Scorsese lead and into the supporting role as William King Hale, where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story. Hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth, regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it. His intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain, with little regard for the wellbeing of others, even his nephew. What I consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the Bible says about spreading the Word of God. His claim that God wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil, and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film. A role like this is perfect for an actor like Robert De Niro, and what better director to show this to the world than Martin Scorsese?However, the film's true standout would have to be Lily Gladstone as Mollie, who is truly the heart and soul of this story. Here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life, whether it's her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives. Yet, despite all these hardships, Mollie remains as steadfast as ever, choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children. Mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds, and she is among the last of her family who hasn't completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle. This is easily a career defining role for Gladstone, and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one day.For the American history buff and the Martin Scorsese fan, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds. It brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another well-crafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veteran's library. As mentioned previously, it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film, which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period. After all, as the classic saying goes - those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.I rate it a solid 9/10.","19 October 2023","5/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Touches upon an often overlooked piece of American history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and cast","MrDHWong","Some films warrant long runtimes. Epics like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Das Boot' are both over three hours in length, and rocket along at a brisk pace, largely because of fastidious editing. The duration of both those pictures is necessary, one could argue, to tell their stories without sacrificing details, coherence or excitement. Then, there are films like 'Heaven's Gate,' which also has a runtime of over three hours, and is a bloated, self-indulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director Michael Cimino's arrogant refusal to cut anything.Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' teeters somewhere between both camps. It has elements deserving of high praise, but is inarguably too long, with pacing, structural and narrative issues galore. Based on the non-fiction novel of the same name by David Grann, the film centers on Emmet Burkhart, a simple-minded World War I Veteran who returns to The Osage Nation, to the home of his uncle William King Hale. There, Emmet falls for an Osage named Mollie, who- his uncle tells him- is set to inherit much of her people's oil headrights. Meanwhile, someone is killing off the wealthy Osage in the area; and it looks like Mollie's family might be next.On paper, it sounds like a fascinating, exciting picture, with dashes of psychological intrigue. However, Scorsese's version of the tale is dour, swollen and predictable. Grann's riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed, lacking any kind of suspense or momentum. Screenwriters Scorsese and Eric Roth cram too much into the narrative- namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa. They have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly; which they don't do, preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play out.Had Scorsese and longtime collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth, things could have been different. There are some brilliant sequences in the movie, in fact, the first third is engaging and intriguing. The mystery is successfully set up, the location established and the characters introduced, then things start going downhill. The pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime; until the end, of course, when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion. Beyond pacing, there are some fundamental flaws editing-wise that are inexplicable, considering Scorsese and Schoonmaker's prestige.For example, seemingly important characters are introduced, then disappear for long stretches of time. Similarly, the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times, or overlooked; leaving us in the dark. Furthermore, at times, cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak. All this- including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative- is amateur work; far below Scorsese and Schoonmaker's level.This is not to say, however, that 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is without redeeming elements. To make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation, no matter its effectiveness. Scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new- although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the Osage people. The film doesn't explore the historical or cultural context of the Osage Nation, nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivors.Scorsese and Roth's narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the Osage, or the systemic injustice that they face. Their characterisation lacks depth or nuance, relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes. Had he focused on the perspective and agency of the Osage, rather than the corrupt, inept white characters; Scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his hands.Conversely, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is evocative and enchanting. It makes for a stunning watch, proving Scorsese's eye for visuals has not been blinded. Under Scorsese's direction, Prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the Oklahoma landscape astutely, while Jack Fisk's detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness; which Adam Willis's set decoration and Jacqueline West's costume design only compounds.Moreover, the late, great Robbie Robertson's score is striking, bearing a resemblance to the work of Ry Cooder. Full of sleazy slide guitars and Indian chants, it complements the narrative perfectly. The inclusion of period-accurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism, which- in the times of Baz Luhrmann, who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces- is most welcome. The last project Robertson worked on before his death; his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansong.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Emmet, alongside Lily Gladstone as Mollie and Robert DeNiro as King Hale. DiCaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances, but here takes a page out of the Daniel Day Lewis playbook: the most intense acting must surely be the best. DiCaprio spends the whole film frowning, scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his character's expressions and eccentricities. In the first third, he has a bit of range; though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performance.As does Lily Gladstone. Initially, she creates in Mollie a nuanced and witty character, who can see through people. She doesn't suffer fools, and we find her both compelling and captivating. However, after the first third of the film, she becomes subservient, unquestioning and dull- and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being, shall we say, slowed down. DeNiro, for his part, plays King Hale like an evil George Burns: manipulative, darkly funny and morally bereft. Anytime he's on screen, the film is a joy; he's the best thing about it.They are supported by a large cast of talented actors, some of whom do great work. Ty Mitchell is excellent as John, a poor man drawn into Emmet and King Hale's plans, who has more dignity then the both of them combined. Jesse Plemons does typically fine work as FBI man Tom White, while Louis Cancelmi is seedily slick as Kelsie Morrison, a stooge of King Hale's. On the other hand, the likes of Cara Jade Myers- as Mollie's alcoholic sister- and Brendan Fraser- in a thankfully small role as King Hale's lawyer- are both so miscast and over the top, they distract from everything going on around them.It's a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a Dean Martin song (The Money Song) from 1948: ""Them that have it, get more of it. The less they need it, the more they love it."" Such is the thesis of the film: greed spreads like a plague, and the richer you are, the greedier you are. It's not original, nor is it profound: this very same tale was told much more impactfully back in 1959, in Mervyn LeRoy's 'The FBI Story.'At the end of the day, 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is a truncated adaptation of a great non-fiction book, overlong and devoid of any original or meaningful message. Despite its stellar cinematography, evocative score and a few powerful performances, Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' is an underwhelming disappointment.","22 October 2023","9/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers Of The Audience's Bladders","boblipton","Martin Scorsese follows up his sloppy The Irishman with another excursion in indulgence and overnarration. For three and a half hours, he tells the story of the Osage Indian murders in Osage County, Oklahoma at the beginning of the 20th century, but this is not a cinematic work; it's a visual retelling of literature. The narrative is so unfocused, longwinded, and loquacious that watching the movie is like listening to a busker going at it repetitiously for hours on end. And the story, although fascinating enough in a historical context, has an unappealing revisionist whiff about it and is often reduced to a simple us-and-them dichotomy. Scorsese keeps pounding his narrative drum like that aforementioned busker, but The Killers of the Flower Moon never becomes the grandiose, epic drama it purports to be, and it desperately lacks subtlety.

It would have been better to hear it all and investigate it because then all the info is waiting there to be discovered.

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","tough watch","SnoopyStyle","First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered.

"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Somewhere in the middle for me","petervd","I strongly recommend reading the book over the film. It's clear that movies simply can not communicate the same amount of events and information that books can, but that is not what's wrong here. I would say the movie is mostly faithful to the book (except with certain chronological order of events). The problem is that reading the book was a vastly more exciting experience, especially how the events unfolded. I don't understand Scorese's decision to ditch the mystery and replace it with nothing by giving away right away who's behind it all. We don't even get a solid character study since DiCaprio's character (and performance) is one-dimensional, so is DeNiro's unfortunately. You have this back and forth between these two characters, and it's always the same dynamic. Even their final scene in what is supposed to be a cathartic moment for one character felt nothing short of underwhelming. One good thing I can say is that the movie doesn't feel like three and a half hours. Although the first hour is clearly the best part, with the rest of the movie dragging quite a bit, due to it's repetitive nature. Choosing to tell the story from a perpetrator's point of view felt like a safe choice, Scorese has done this before (and much better I might add) . There are several cross cuts, upshots and stylistic choices that are straight out of Goodfellas which rubbed me the wrong way given the nature of the material. A few nice visual ideas here and there, can't breathe life into a drab screenplay. One of the best parts of the book was the investigation of Tom White into the murders which was a true Herculean act and the scientific evolution of methods like fingerprint identification. Whereas the movie zaps through it, and therefore makes it look like it was very easy to catch and convict the conspiracy behind this. The book showed a dimension of government corruption and systematic sanctioned murder that went way beyond mere individuals, which the movie simply failed to portray properly. The end coda with the Lucky Strike radio show was another one of those tame attempts to upset the audience. All it did for me, was reminding me of a similar scene in a much much better movie 'The Assassination of Jessie James by the Coward Bob Ford' where two brothers reenact the famous murder in a theater play. I think this movie would have been in better hands by a director like Andrew Dominic but I still commend Scoresese for putting a spotlight on this important part of American history.","22 October 2023","7/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of my patience","Med-Jasta","The story of a conspiratorial plot to kill members of the Osage Nation for their bountiful oil wealth in 1920's Oklahoma is one that was unfamiliar to me until Martin Scorsese decided to make his Killers Of The Flower Moon, a three and a half hour epic that impresses on every technical level and flounders on the thematic and emotional ones. Perhaps it was my neglect in doing the proper research or reading the nonfiction book this is based on that partially led to it feeling cold, detached and disarrayed, but in any case it has not resonated for me the way it has for some. Leonardo DiCaprio is cast jarringly against type as Ernest, a cowardly quasi WWII vet who is pressured by his amoral, Machiavellian uncle King Hale (Robert De Niro) into marrying wealthy Osage woman Mollie (Lily Gladstone) and insinuating his own lineage into the oil rights that get passed along through wedlock. Much of the film is distressing in the sense that we, the audience, know exactly the sort of insidious betrayal that is happening, both at large with everybody in the region and on a more intimate level with Ernest and Mollie. I saw an interview with Scorsese where he seemed excited to tell a story that has all the same scheming, backstabbing and psychopathic double-crossing of his urban crime sagas, but in a far wilder, more rural and spatially wide open locale. He further told of his interest in the story of a woman fatally and unforgivably betrayed by her partner in the worst way, and what that might look like onscreen thematically. Well he seems far more interested in the first part and indeed the overall tapestry of crime, clandestine wrongdoing and often unnecessarily blunt, comedic upheavals in fortune is a well oiled (pun intended) machine here, because that vernacular is solidly within his wheelhouse. It's in that second part, the more intimate picture of a false marriage and unspeakable betrayal that he consistently shies away from exploring in the sort of raw, elemental detail and unflinching eye for emotion that is required here. Only Lily Gladstone, who undeniably gives the film's best performance is really up to the task, imbuing Mollie with a smouldering ancestral rage and elegant, angelic poise that is utterly captivating. But she's marooned in a tempest of misguided choices, missed opportunities to really make this story flare up alive and political clockwork fanfare that clouds over any real chance at true poignancy or catharsis. I've read the backstory of this film and how Scorsese pivoted away from the original plan to tell of the FBI's eventual involvement (they were ultimately, sadly too little too late here) and towards a deliberate focus on the Osage, their plight and identity as a people within this tragic turmoil. Well, he doesn't really achieve that beyond expository newsreel montages, round-table elder discussions and an admittedly impressive eye for costume. There is a scene where senior members of the tribe mention that ""if they could see their enemy, they would kill them"" but they seem to have no idea who is perpetrating these atrocities against them. ...really? From a narrative standpoint it's pretty darn clear and the fact that none of them, Mollie especially, look anywhere close to home in their suspicions simply didn't ring true for me. She is such a well rounded character played beautifully and hauntingly by Gladstone, but the well earned outrage and eventual catastrophic corrosion of her marriage to a man like Ernest, rife with red flags from the outset I might add, is something that Scorsese frustratingly sidesteps, stifles and outright avoids in favour of cold procedural. I can't help but wonder if this story, meant to be told from the perspective of the Osage, may have been better off in other, more edgy and esoteric hands.","19 October 2023","4/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","Killers of the Flower Moon","CinemaSerf","I feel like I watched a different movie from many of the reviews. I went to the theater, with high expectations.The movie is a brutally honest story of moral bankruptcy, corruption and decimation of a tribe at the hands of local landowners. Only this story is different - it's not the typical settlers moving west and battling tribes. It's taking the land through marriage, murder and inheritance. The movie is shot well and the acting is top notch for what they are working with.Now for the bad: it is in desperate need of editing! 3.5 hours is fine if the story keeps pace and moves the plot with pertinent scenes. This is not the case. There is at least 1.5 hours of drawn out scenes and scenes that are completely irrelevant (like the random goofy white guy dancing at a fair for almost 15 minutes. He is never seen before or after). I felt like the story was being told by my elderly grandfather and he would lose pace and ramble about things that are unrelated to any of the events taking place.There are full conversations in the native languages, with no subtitles. It is incredibly irritating. Why does DiCaprio talk like he has marbles in his mouth? Deniro was definitely miscast and should retire. Time passes over a period of days, months and years with no discernible shift to let you know more than a day has passed. And a sudden shift at the end to the format of a radio show was both distasteful and surreal. It left the audience anxious to leave the minute the screen darkened.Sadly, I would not recommend this movie.","23 October 2023","7/10",NA
"Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)","What a disappointment","ChrisScreenwriter","Visually, the movie was well-shot and the setting was great. And I didn't find the movie dull for the 3.5hrs running time, which could have shaved off an hour or so. I guess because it kept shifting tone and angle every half an hour, which could have worked in its favour, you were left hoping it would have some sort of pay off ending or climactic conclusion. Sadly. That doesn't happen.One big issue with this film is the lack of a hero or protagonist you could relate to. The main character, Ernest, was a villain. His wife, who you would have hoped would have taken up the 'heroine' role, was mainly an invalid, victim through the entire movie (after the wedding). We never get to find out more about how the wealth ran through the community, why Hale wanted it for himself, or if he was in league with others, since there were suspicious deaths happening before Molly's family. We never get a sense of where Hale is coming from or even his family, he's just the archetype crime lord, getting others to do his work, and selling them out when they cease to be of use. DiCaprio seemed to be teetering into Sling Blade territory with his characterization. And we know that his character Ernest has a brother Byron, also involved in all this, but you never really see them act like blood relatives. There doesn't seem to be any relationship at all.Then there were those distracting cameos. The worst was Brendan Fraser's outburst in the court room. I almost forgot what movie I was watching, it was that bad. Then we seem him in a scene with a bunch of supposedly powerful men trying to convince Ernest to do the 'right thing', pointing to a greater conspiracy, but then leaving it hanging.The end was terrible, cutting to some radio program that almost destroys the atmosphere of the film that had just preceded it. It felt cheap and trite. And Scorsese's cameo, another distraction, was almost self-serving.So while I am glad this terrible incident in US history has been brought to light through this film, I don't feel it said much or took any stance. A wishy washy effort by Marty.","18 October 2023","5/10",NA

Overall, a miss in my eyes as the animation style does not make up for its poor execution and writing (with its corny use of modern references and poor plot construction making it too short to leave any profound effect), though children/fans of the TMNT franchise may like this movie more than me.Pretty Bad Direction (Moves the story in a pretty formulaic way (so decent); does a pretty good job in the action sequences as they are animated well; the interpersonal scenes feel more awkward as there is just a lot of empty space from it being corny and not relatable; the scenes where they try to drive messages and development forward are pretty shallow and not that meaningful; does not feel like he directed the voice actors well), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting (Decent from Jackie Chan (The main issue is I have heard Jackie Chan give better vocal performances than this and it just feels like he wasn't given that great of direction), Decent to Pretty Good from Ice Cube (The best vocal performance in the movie but feels like he was very limited given the direction and the movie being PG (he wanted to go off and be explicit and it shows)), Decent to Pretty Good from Ayo Edebiri (Does a good job in being the awkward side character and shows some depth and range), Decent from Giancarlo Esposito, Decent from Seth Rogen (Really is not given that much to work with but does a decent job), Decent from Paul Rudd (Does a decent job at being the comedic relief for the mutants), Decent from Maya Rudolph (Holds her own decently and does a good job at being a separate menacing antagonist), Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Does not include the child voice actors; it just feels like there were so many unmemorable performances in the movie that it was hard to keep up with who was even each character and how relevant they were)), Pretty Bad Story (The story was pretty formulaic and too short overall; there was not any character development for the principal characters (which is a shame cause its supposed to be a pseudo-origin story); does a decent job at tying the story elements together throughout the movie (like referencing parts from the beginning to help drive the end)), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was pretty messy overall (I get the kids were doing improv, but I never wanna hear 'rizz' or 'ocky way' in a movie again (this movie will be cringey and dated in years to come); the attempts at humor missed the mark a lot of times as it came off more as corny than relatable for me; the symbolism was kinda shallow (but they did explain and tie things up well); foreshadowing was kinda decent (but a bit overt) as they used different elements from the beginning to tie things up in the climax), Decent Score/Pretty Good Soundtrack (though not very well used at times), Decent Sound, Pretty Good Visual Effects/Animation (The overall style had some charm to it being less polished and more choppy/comic-book based (which was a stylistic choice that I did enjoy, but there were many times where the dialogue scenes felt too cheap as the mouths of the characters did not match their words); the fight scenes were well animated; the cuts with real-world videos felt very tacky and cheap), Plot Structure was pretty formulaic and not that well set up as the movie was a bit too short (the rising action of them coming into their powers and rising as a fighting team was just a short montage (ruining their character development)); it would have been nice to have seen 15 minutes used to help give them more scenes where they learn to become better crime fighters, Pacing was fine (the issue is the plot was too short and could use a longer runtime), Climax was animated well (but felt a bit corny and predictable), Tone was pretty similar to other TMNT property (so a bit childish in its humor mixed with action fighting scenes)","11 September 2023","5/10",NA
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)","An unexpected delight","ta-98251","Yet another absolutely failed attempt at re-invigorating the TMNT film world. With every one of these newer entries comedy is forced to try to appeal to the times. This one is easily the most banal mostly thanks to the dryest of the dry ,Seth Rogen. I don't know how that guy ever even got his foot in the door to Hollywood because he is one of the most unfunny people around. The casting is also horrendously bad especially for the turtles themselves. Each one of the voice actors is not even close to the personality that should be brought to each of the individual turtles. The odd changes they made for certain characters and what they look like seem so desperately forced it's sickening. The only interesting factor of this film is the animation style which is just a rip off of the recemt also overrated spiderverse. At least some of it looks somewhat cool.

"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)","Pretty Bad Movie","cinemapersonified","Things I liked:I liked that they used actual teen actors for the turtles for the first time, and getting them to record at the same time created a natural, but at times chaotic and difficult to decipher, dialogue.Splinter's character was more fatherly and less focused on the strict sensei/teacher role.Superfly was a decent central villain with a bit of a backstory. He was kind of likeable to start with and turned quite dark and psychotic. Well acted by Ice Cube and gave the character some depth.The action set pieces were exciting and fast paced.The art style is different enough to make it visually interesting and the colours pop.A decent soundtrack of East coast hip-hop tunes.Things I didn't like:April is supposed to be a vulnerable teen who is a victim of bullying, but she came across a little annoying and arrogant, with an attitude, making it difficult to warm to her.Michelangelo wasn't ""Mikey"" enough, not the silly 'party dude'. Donatello didn't 'do machines' either, no gadgets or creations. There was a definite lack of distinction between the individual turtles personalities.Many of the villains felt under used and had little screen time. With dialogue often difficult to hear clearly due to background music or sounds. They also seemed very easily swayed over their allegiance.The origin story was changed and didn't make as much sense, but I guess it meant that they could drop Shredder and skim over it in 5 mins.Love it or hate it, the art style is different enough to appreciate, but I hated the use of real world footage at the movie and on YouTube. It snapped you out of the world they had created. At one point I thought the cinema had randomly started playing a different film.Some blatant product placement.Deliberate gender and race swapping, that felt forced to appease the Hollywood quotas, and often failed to hit the mark.Some poorly forced 'jokes' and cultural references that were often over pushed and quite literally 'milked'.","2 August 2023","5/10",NA
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)","Rogen turns the turtles into Tik tok Gen mediocrity.","tresm87","Mutant Mayhem is the TMNT film that every iteration of these characters has been leading up to. Yes, the original film from the 90s will forever remain, but also forever be limited by the technology and technique of the times. The Michael Bay films...while ambitious and appropriate for the time, felt a bit silly in taking these characters so seriously.TMNT: Mutant Mayhem straddles the line between self-awareness and seriousness. This is a surprisingly sweet, heartfelt, and earnest film that carries some serious heart and, dare I say, humanity. It's a movie that explores something that other iterations have only briefly touched on: what it feels like to be a teenager, let alone one who has to be afraid of what the rest of the world thinks of you. It's nice to see a film that isn't cynical about humanity, and celebrates the best of us, whilst acknowledging our complexity. We need more of that.This is a movie that subverts our expectations and challenges our preconceived notions of what an ""action film"" should be. It's absolutely hilarious, with a snappy, quick witted, almost mumble core style that I immediately gravitated to. I was honestly shocked how well-written and funny this movie is. It has so many great lines and call backs (again, they overdo it a tad) that had me bellowing. It's also a movie that intelligently analyzes the Turtles mythos and makes the brilliant decision not to waste the characters. (You'll get what I mean when you see it).You can tell when actors are having a ton of fun with the material, and it just shone through in every frame of this movie.Speaking of which, the Turtles - Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Raphael (Brady Noon), Donatello (Micah Abbey) and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.) are absolutely perfect. For the first time, they feel like teenagers and exude a youthful energy that is really difficult to capture sometimes. They have excellent chemistry, even if I felt they sometimes blended together; we're used to the Turtles having extremely distinct personalities and it's not really the case here. I can see that bugging some people, but there's enough of these characters' historical tendencies here that it's obvious their distinct interpersonal dynamics will eventually be fleshed out in sequels. These are the Turtles at the youngest we've ever seen them, after all.I also have to shout out Ice Cube's Superfly. He's an awesome villain, with Mr. Cube shouldering a lot of the load in making him charismatic, funny, and threatening. Jackie Chan was a natural choice for Splinter and he's obviously fantastic; I'm genuinely surprised he hasn't played this role before. The rest of the mutant gang is great, if a bit under utilized; Seth Rogen's Bebop and John Cena's Rocksteady - characters we've all been dying to see - don't get as much screen time as I assumed they would, but it's fine.Ayo Edebiri's April O'Neil has (unsurprisingly) annoyed some, as she's, you know...a Gen Z person, but I thought Edebiri and the writers did a great job of modernizing the character and having her make sense with this new take.I didn't even mention the GORGEOUS animation, which feels a bit more evolutionary than revolutionary, but is all the same a welcome change. Remember the TMNT movie from 2007? The one with pixels and polygons? This film - in the vein of Spiderverse - eschews realism for a deliberately hand-drawn, cell-shaded look that harkens back to kids scribbling the Turtles in the their notebooks while bored in class. It's a brilliant decision and makes the film worth watching for the visuals alone. (I also like how steeped in the 80s aesthetic and weirdness this film is).One last thing...the music. My God. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross never miss, and the last thing I expected was for the music to be so amazing and memorable, but they did it again. With a killer 80s synth/sci-fi vibe, this movie's soundtrack is worth listening to by itself (I've been putting it on while working and it's perfect). A+ song choices as well.If I had any complaints, I do think the film takes a bit too long to get going, but once it does, it's paced extremely well. I felt the pop culture infused dialog (whilst realistic) did veer into product placement territory (and yes, there were some distracting product placements as well), which took me out of the film at times. I also felt the sound mixing was off in some scenes, which could've been my theatre, but there was a tinny sound, especially in the beginning. Oh, and there is an over reliance on overly expository dialog that I felt could've have been modified a little bit. The movie stops, multiple times, to deliver exposition in a way that I felt was a bit unnecessary.Overall though...this may be one of my favourite movies of the year. It's truly wonderful, sweet, exciting, funny, and endlessly entertaining and heartfelt. It was the Turtles movie I didn't know I needed, and now I can't wait for the sequel. And yes, there will (likely) be a sequel, and yes...HE will be in it. If you know, you know.","6 August 2023","4/10",NA

Overall, a miss in my eyes as the animation style does not make up for its poor execution and writing (with its corny use of modern references and poor plot construction making it too short to leave any profound effect), though children/fans of the TMNT franchise may like this movie more than me.Pretty Bad Direction (Moves the story in a pretty formulaic way (so decent); does a pretty good job in the action sequences as they are animated well; the interpersonal scenes feel more awkward as there is just a lot of empty space from it being corny and not relatable; the scenes where they try to drive messages and development forward are pretty shallow and not that meaningful; does not feel like he directed the voice actors well), Pretty Bad to Decent Acting (Decent from Jackie Chan (The main issue is I have heard Jackie Chan give better vocal performances than this and it just feels like he wasn't given that great of direction), Decent to Pretty Good from Ice Cube (The best vocal performance in the movie but feels like he was very limited given the direction and the movie being PG (he wanted to go off and be explicit and it shows)), Decent to Pretty Good from Ayo Edebiri (Does a good job in being the awkward side character and shows some depth and range), Decent from Giancarlo Esposito, Decent from Seth Rogen (Really is not given that much to work with but does a decent job), Decent from Paul Rudd (Does a decent job at being the comedic relief for the mutants), Decent from Maya Rudolph (Holds her own decently and does a good job at being a separate menacing antagonist), Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Does not include the child voice actors; it just feels like there were so many unmemorable performances in the movie that it was hard to keep up with who was even each character and how relevant they were)), Pretty Bad Story (The story was pretty formulaic and too short overall; there was not any character development for the principal characters (which is a shame cause its supposed to be a pseudo-origin story); does a decent job at tying the story elements together throughout the movie (like referencing parts from the beginning to help drive the end)), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was pretty messy overall (I get the kids were doing improv, but I never wanna hear 'rizz' or 'ocky way' in a movie again (this movie will be cringey and dated in years to come); the attempts at humor missed the mark a lot of times as it came off more as corny than relatable for me; the symbolism was kinda shallow (but they did explain and tie things up well); foreshadowing was kinda decent (but a bit overt) as they used different elements from the beginning to tie things up in the climax), Decent Score/Pretty Good Soundtrack (though not very well used at times), Decent Sound, Pretty Good Visual Effects/Animation (The overall style had some charm to it being less polished and more choppy/comic-book based (which was a stylistic choice that I did enjoy, but there were many times where the dialogue scenes felt too cheap as the mouths of the characters did not match their words); the fight scenes were well animated; the cuts with real-world videos felt very tacky and cheap), Plot Structure was pretty formulaic and not that well set up as the movie was a bit too short (the rising action of them coming into their powers and rising as a fighting team was just a short montage (ruining their character development)); it would have been nice to have seen 15 minutes used to help give them more scenes where they learn to become better crime fighters, Pacing was fine (the issue is the plot was too short and could use a longer runtime), Climax was animated well (but felt a bit corny and predictable), Tone was pretty similar to other TMNT property (so a bit childish in its humor mixed with action fighting scenes)","11 September 2023","5/10",NA

"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)","Rogen turns the turtles into Tik tok Gen mediocrity.","tresm87","Mutant Mayhem is the TMNT film that every iteration of these characters has been leading up to. Yes, the original film from the 90s will forever remain, but also forever be limited by the technology and technique of the times. The Michael Bay films...while ambitious and appropriate for the time, felt a bit silly in taking these characters so seriously.TMNT: Mutant Mayhem straddles the line between self-awareness and seriousness. This is a surprisingly sweet, heartfelt, and earnest film that carries some serious heart and, dare I say, humanity. It's a movie that explores something that other iterations have only briefly touched on: what it feels like to be a teenager, let alone one who has to be afraid of what the rest of the world thinks of you. It's nice to see a film that isn't cynical about humanity, and celebrates the best of us, whilst acknowledging our complexity. We need more of that.This is a movie that subverts our expectations and challenges our preconceived notions of what an ""action film"" should be. It's absolutely hilarious, with a snappy, quick witted, almost mumble core style that I immediately gravitated to. I was honestly shocked how well-written and funny this movie is. It has so many great lines and call backs (again, they overdo it a tad) that had me bellowing. It's also a movie that intelligently analyzes the Turtles mythos and makes the brilliant decision not to waste the characters. (You'll get what I mean when you see it).You can tell when actors are having a ton of fun with the material, and it just shone through in every frame of this movie.Speaking of which, the Turtles - Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Raphael (Brady Noon), Donatello (Micah Abbey) and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.) are absolutely perfect. For the first time, they feel like teenagers and exude a youthful energy that is really difficult to capture sometimes. They have excellent chemistry, even if I felt they sometimes blended together; we're used to the Turtles having extremely distinct personalities and it's not really the case here. I can see that bugging some people, but there's enough of these characters' historical tendencies here that it's obvious their distinct interpersonal dynamics will eventually be fleshed out in sequels. These are the Turtles at the youngest we've ever seen them, after all.I also have to shout out Ice Cube's Superfly. He's an awesome villain, with Mr. Cube shouldering a lot of the load in making him charismatic, funny, and threatening. Jackie Chan was a natural choice for Splinter and he's obviously fantastic; I'm genuinely surprised he hasn't played this role before. The rest of the mutant gang is great, if a bit under utilized; Seth Rogen's Bebop and John Cena's Rocksteady - characters we've all been dying to see - don't get as much screen time as I assumed they would, but it's fine.Ayo Edebiri's April O'Neil has (unsurprisingly) annoyed some, as she's, you know...a Gen Z person, but I thought Edebiri and the writers did a great job of modernizing the character and having her make sense with this new take.I didn't even mention the GORGEOUS animation, which feels a bit more evolutionary than revolutionary, but is all the same a welcome change. Remember the TMNT movie from 2007? The one with pixels and polygons? This film - in the vein of Spiderverse - eschews realism for a deliberately hand-drawn, cell-shaded look that harkens back to kids scribbling the Turtles in the their notebooks while bored in class. It's a brilliant decision and makes the film worth watching for the visuals alone. (I also like how steeped in the 80s aesthetic and weirdness this film is).One last thing...the music. My God. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross never miss, and the last thing I expected was for the music to be so amazing and memorable, but they did it again. With a killer 80s synth/sci-fi vibe, this movie's soundtrack is worth listening to by itself (I've been putting it on while working and it's perfect). A+ song choices as well.If I had any complaints, I do think the film takes a bit too long to get going, but once it does, it's paced extremely well. I felt the pop culture infused dialog (whilst realistic) did veer into product placement territory (and yes, there were some distracting product placements as well), which took me out of the film at times. I also felt the sound mixing was off in some scenes, which could've been my theatre, but there was a tinny sound, especially in the beginning. Oh, and there is an over reliance on overly expository dialog that I felt could've have been modified a little bit. The movie stops, multiple times, to deliver exposition in a way that I felt was a bit unnecessary.Overall though...this may be one of my favourite movies of the year. It's truly wonderful, sweet, exciting, funny, and endlessly entertaining and heartfelt. It was the Turtles movie I didn't know I needed, and now I can't wait for the sequel. And yes, there will (likely) be a sequel, and yes...HE will be in it. If you know, you know.","6 August 2023","4/10",NA

"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)","Wonderful animation!","jp_91","Yet another origin for these characters, one that is vastly different from ""classic"" Turtles.I wasn't expecting anything, and as a kid that grew up with the 1987's cartoon, it gave me nothing. Truthfully, it wasn't made to appeal to me (I'm not buying or playing with toys anymore).. but I still think most of these changes to be a downgrade affecting the general world-building, a few of the main characters (O'Neil, Baxter and Splinter), and even some minor villains' standing. But as a release made only to capitalize on merchandise for children, it doesn't have to be anything more than what it is. I can see kids having fun and coming out wanting to ""kick things"".As a film, it has awkward sound mixing and a soundtrack that assists with the griminess of the world. But it is visually quite interesting and the action is energetic, with a ""scribbles"" style that is very different! And while I appreciate the casting of actual teenagers, I'm not sure about the improvised-feeling dialogue. The rest of the cast is completely forgettable (your Adam Sandler-like crew that do their job and pad the IMDB with ""talent""). The writing is also terribly familiar, predictable and somewhat dull. It isn't particularly good, even if modern.I still don't like seth rogen putting his grease hands on as many properties as he is financially capable off, since he is clearly not a good writer, actor or franchise builder. But if it's good enough for kids.. then by all means, make more (which is certainly better than nothing at all).","12 August 2023","7/10",NA
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)","""Teenage Mutant Kung-Fu Turtles""","daisukereds","I was never really a fan of the comics, nor was I fond of the original animated show; if I'm being frank, it's the stylistic visuals in the trailer and the promos that grabbed my attention in the first place and lured me into watching this cinematic adaptation.So what do I think of it, as an impartial audience? As somebody who knows only the very basics about the source material? Well, it's strictly average.I will be honest with you all: I expected much better. The animations are vivid, and the score slaps hard, too, but the characters, as well as the writing, leave a lot to be desired! Despite having an eventful script, I hardly felt engaged with the happenings or was able to establish any personal connection. If truth be told, I lost interest in the middle, and by the end, I couldn't care less about anything or anyone.I wish my experience turned out differently.","5 August 2023","5/10",NA
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)","Oof","statuskuo","Firstly, the animation for this film is exceptional. A truly unique depiction of New York. It's gritty, it's rugged but it also feel inviting. The scenic images and close up character shots feels like they have been ripped from the pages of a comic book.Whilst this may be an origin movie, the film is well paced and doesn't dwell on any one area for too long. After an introduction and 15 year time jump, we quickly get to understand the feelings and motivations of the characters which drive the plot in a natural manner.As a result the characters feel real which make for interesting on screen interactions. Splinter is an overly protective Father whilst the turtles are teenagers trying to grow out of their shells. Set in modern day New York, these Teenage Turtles are up to speed with pop culture which leads to funny one liners, easter eggs and mentions.The voice acting is great all round. Ice Cube is fantastic as Superfly, a street wise villain with a disdain for humans. At its heart, TMNT: Ninja Mayhem is a film about fitting it, growth and acceptance between amongst both humans and 'mutants'. This results in a perfect mix of a fun, comedy and a heartfelt story which can be enjoyed by everybody young and old.","5 September 2023","4/10",NA

Truthfully, it wasn't made to appeal to me (I'm not buying or playing with toys anymore).. but I still think most of these changes to be a downgrade affecting the general world-building, a few of the main characters (O'Neil, Baxter and Splinter), and even some minor villains' standing. But as a release made only to capitalize on merchandise for children, it doesn't have to be anything more than what it is. I can see kids having fun and coming out wanting to ""kick things"".As a film, it has awkward sound mixing and a soundtrack that assists with the griminess of the world. But it is visually quite interesting and the action is energetic, with a ""scribbles"" style that is very different! And while I appreciate the casting of actual teenagers, I'm not sure about the improvised-feeling dialogue. The rest of the cast is completely forgettable (your Adam Sandler-like crew that do their job and pad the IMDB with ""talent""). The writing is also terribly familiar, predictable and somewhat dull. It isn't particularly good, even if modern.I still don't like seth rogen putting his grease hands on as many properties as he is financially capable off, since he is clearly not a good writer, actor or franchise builder.

"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)","Oof","statuskuo","Firstly, the animation for this film is exceptional. A truly unique depiction of New York. It's gritty, it's rugged but it also feel inviting. The scenic images and close up character shots feels like they have been ripped from the pages of a comic book.Whilst this may be an origin movie, the film is well paced and doesn't dwell on any one area for too long. After an introduction and 15 year time jump, we quickly get to understand the feelings and motivations of the characters which drive the plot in a natural manner.As a result the characters feel real which make for interesting on screen interactions. Splinter is an overly protective Father whilst the turtles are teenagers trying to grow out of their shells. Set in modern day New York, these Teenage Turtles are up to speed with pop culture which leads to funny one liners, easter eggs and mentions.The voice acting is great all round. Ice Cube is fantastic as Superfly, a street wise villain with a disdain for humans. At its heart, TMNT: Ninja Mayhem is a film about fitting it, growth and acceptance between amongst both humans and 'mutants'. This results in a perfect mix of a fun, comedy and a heartfelt story which can be enjoyed by everybody young and old.","5 September 2023","4/10",NA

"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)","Rogen turns the turtles into Tik tok Gen mediocrity.","tresm87","Mutant Mayhem is the TMNT film that every iteration of these characters has been leading up to. Yes, the original film from the 90s will forever remain, but also forever be limited by the technology and technique of the times. The Michael Bay films...while ambitious and appropriate for the time, felt a bit silly in taking these characters so seriously.TMNT: Mutant Mayhem straddles the line between self-awareness and seriousness. This is a surprisingly sweet, heartfelt, and earnest film that carries some serious heart and, dare I say, humanity. It's a movie that explores something that other iterations have only briefly touched on: what it feels like to be a teenager, let alone one who has to be afraid of what the rest of the world thinks of you. It's nice to see a film that isn't cynical about humanity, and celebrates the best of us, whilst acknowledging our complexity. We need more of that.This is a movie that subverts our expectations and challenges our preconceived notions of what an ""action film"" should be. It's absolutely hilarious, with a snappy, quick witted, almost mumble core style that I immediately gravitated to. I was honestly shocked how well-written and funny this movie is. It has so many great lines and call backs (again, they overdo it a tad) that had me bellowing. It's also a movie that intelligently analyzes the Turtles mythos and makes the brilliant decision not to waste the characters. (You'll get what I mean when you see it).You can tell when actors are having a ton of fun with the material, and it just shone through in every frame of this movie.Speaking of which, the Turtles - Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Raphael (Brady Noon), Donatello (Micah Abbey) and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.) are absolutely perfect. For the first time, they feel like teenagers and exude a youthful energy that is really difficult to capture sometimes. They have excellent chemistry, even if I felt they sometimes blended together; we're used to the Turtles having extremely distinct personalities and it's not really the case here. I can see that bugging some people, but there's enough of these characters' historical tendencies here that it's obvious their distinct interpersonal dynamics will eventually be fleshed out in sequels. These are the Turtles at the youngest we've ever seen them, after all.I also have to shout out Ice Cube's Superfly. He's an awesome villain, with Mr. Cube shouldering a lot of the load in making him charismatic, funny, and threatening. Jackie Chan was a natural choice for Splinter and he's obviously fantastic; I'm genuinely surprised he hasn't played this role before. The rest of the mutant gang is great, if a bit under utilized; Seth Rogen's Bebop and John Cena's Rocksteady - characters we've all been dying to see - don't get as much screen time as I assumed they would, but it's fine.Ayo Edebiri's April O'Neil has (unsurprisingly) annoyed some, as she's, you know...a Gen Z person, but I thought Edebiri and the writers did a great job of modernizing the character and having her make sense with this new take.I didn't even mention the GORGEOUS animation, which feels a bit more evolutionary than revolutionary, but is all the same a welcome change. Remember the TMNT movie from 2007? The one with pixels and polygons? This film - in the vein of Spiderverse - eschews realism for a deliberately hand-drawn, cell-shaded look that harkens back to kids scribbling the Turtles in the their notebooks while bored in class. It's a brilliant decision and makes the film worth watching for the visuals alone. (I also like how steeped in the 80s aesthetic and weirdness this film is).One last thing...the music. My God. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross never miss, and the last thing I expected was for the music to be so amazing and memorable, but they did it again. With a killer 80s synth/sci-fi vibe, this movie's soundtrack is worth listening to by itself (I've been putting it on while working and it's perfect). A+ song choices as well.If I had any complaints, I do think the film takes a bit too long to get going, but once it does, it's paced extremely well. I felt the pop culture infused dialog (whilst realistic) did veer into product placement territory (and yes, there were some distracting product placements as well), which took me out of the film at times. I also felt the sound mixing was off in some scenes, which could've been my theatre, but there was a tinny sound, especially in the beginning. Oh, and there is an over reliance on overly expository dialog that I felt could've have been modified a little bit. The movie stops, multiple times, to deliver exposition in a way that I felt was a bit unnecessary.Overall though...this may be one of my favourite movies of the year. It's truly wonderful, sweet, exciting, funny, and endlessly entertaining and heartfelt. It was the Turtles movie I didn't know I needed, and now I can't wait for the sequel. And yes, there will (likely) be a sequel, and yes...HE will be in it. If you know, you know.","6 August 2023","4/10",NA
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)","Enjoyable enough ride but falls short overall","dalesimmance","What was that? First of all, the animation was fine and some scenes were great but for the most part, it was a mindless movie with tons of failed joke attempts, forced message and the plot was very rushed. The turtles were, at the most part, acting the same and didn't have the distinct personalities from previous shows, April looked nothing like April (i literally thought she was a different character at first), Splinter was turned into a joke and classic villains were ruined and had no time to shine. I get it that writers try to make changes to stand out and make something more of their own, but the changes just didn't work for me. Sadly, it was yet another mindless wannabe-funny movie for mindless consumers.","23 August 2023","6/10",NA
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)","Visually appealing, but the story is bland","MissSimonetta","Pretty much everything I've wanted in a TMNT movie for decades, just a ton of fun in the theater. I'm as surprised as anybody that we have Seth Rogen to thank for this, but hey, whatever works. And there's plenty to be said about the art style borrowing from the Spiderverse movies, but it just fits. The Animation is vibrant, kinetic and absolutely lends itself to both the action and the humor. The whole movie looks like the margin drawings of a high schooler's notebook, that unrefined pencil and marker aesthetic.For me, the biggest present under this Christmas tree is the age-appropriate cast. Their chemistry is incredible and the turtles actually sound and feel like teenagers for once. As much as I gravitate towards Mikey in any given iteration, Donatello had all of the killer one-liners here; I loved Micah Abbey's performance.Maybe it's because of this Summer's frustrating movie season, but I left the theater with a real high after this. If the turtles needed a reboot, this was the way to go, and I enjoyed it from start to finish. Even that feels like an understatement ... I had a blast!","15 August 2023","6/10",NA

Oh, and there is an over reliance on overly expository dialog that I felt could've have been modified a little bit. The movie stops, multiple times, to deliver exposition in a way that I felt was a bit unnecessary.Overall though...this may be one of my favourite movies of the year. It's truly wonderful, sweet, exciting, funny, and endlessly entertaining and heartfelt. It was the Turtles movie I didn't know I needed, and now I can't wait for the sequel. And yes, there will (likely) be a sequel, and yes...HE will be in it. If you know, you know.","6 August 2023","4/10",NA
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)","Enjoyable enough ride but falls short overall","dalesimmance","What was that? First of all, the animation was fine and some scenes were great but for the most part, it was a mindless movie with tons of failed joke attempts, forced message and the plot was very rushed. The turtles were, at the most part, acting the same and didn't have the distinct personalities from previous shows, April looked nothing like April (i literally thought she was a different character at first), Splinter was turned into a joke and classic villains were ruined and had no time to shine. I get it that writers try to make changes to stand out and make something more of their own, but the changes just didn't work for me. Sadly, it was yet another mindless wannabe-funny movie for mindless consumers.","23 August 2023","6/10",NA

The underground set piece is one of the highlights of the film. Don't worry though. This film is not just a mishmash of action scenes. There are plenty of heart touching moments too. This movie takes all the best aspects from The Hunger Games(2012), The Hunger Games: Catching Fire(2013) & The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1(2014), to become my favorite film in the franchise. There are so many twists & turns in the film that will keep you guessing right till the end(if you haven't read the books, of course). The suspense factor is a welcome addition, that didn't feature in the previous three films. A minor flaw would be the 3D. Although it works in a few scenes, overall the 3D is unnecessary.

"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","The series finishes strongly","neil-476","Slow-paced, navel-gazing, clock-watching, struggling to stay awake - give me back those 2¼ hrs... Anytime an action sequence started (only a few times) it was quickly curtailed and drowned in a dark/black scene, much of the movie is introspection / hand-wringing and dark-dark-dark. I hate movies with a lot of blackness and you can't see what is supposed to be represented on the screen..This was certainly a disappointment following the earlier episodes of the series. Maybe it made sense to keen followers of the books, but heaven help someone who wandered in off the street drawn in by fancy advertising featuring a dynamic, sexy Katniss, and expecting an engrossing thriller.. {yawn}The ""execution"" where Katniss shoots Coin was not entirely unexpected. If I have been Coin I would have been primed to duck, but apparently she was too dumb for that. Nasty way for Snow to die, ripped apart by the Mob, surely Katniss could have dispatched him with a 2nd arrow.. or maybe she had a hidden sadistic streak..So Katniss' fate was to be a Mum/housewife but looks like she already had Peeta well trained..","28 November 2015","9/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","A fitting finale to The Hunger Games franchise.","Anurag-Shetty","I love The Hunger Games trilogy mostly because it is so dark and brutal, and even if Katniss does what she has to do, she still suffers from everything that has happened. In a badly written version of the novels Katniss would behave like nothing ever bothered her, which would make her just seem violent and rash. When we know everything has gotten to her, we know what she is sensitive, we know that everything has actually touched her. The most horrifying thing is when you realise how young Katniss actually is. The original point of the novel series was how kids were forced to fight in the arena, and how a kid actually became the most important person to the resistance. Think about when you were 17, would you have been able to unite people against your oppressors? That's a really horrifying thought - and that was the point Collins was trying to make. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent as Katniss. She portrays her social clumsiness well, but also her emotional weaknesses and her bravery. She's a great actress, but there should've been someone else playing her, someone younger (and Native), because then it would look as terrifying at it was meant to.Not all the events from the novel were included in the Mockingjay part 1 or 2. It's understandable especially when it comes to the part 2. For example, Katniss, Finnick, Johanna and Peeta being trained for the war? It would take too much time to show everything, considering how long the film already was.Some people are complaining about how they should've made the Mockingjay into a one film. I disagree. It is one film, but in two parts. And it works this way, because the second part starts so well - it starts exactly where it should start considering what happened in the end of Part 1. It works as two parts, and there was no need to wrap the story up any more. It was very dense already - things happen quickly but there is still time for important dialogue.The music in these films is almost unreal because of how beautiful it is - and it still is astonishing in the last one.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 2 is dark and brutal, but it has hope, some amazing hope that after all that darkness makes everything better. It's an amazing finale for the best young adult science fiction stories I have read or seen.I feel weird that it's all over now. Suzanne Collins has created amazing characters who were portrayed so well over the years - or left out, as the case may be. Thanks for the ride, it has been amazing.","9 April 2016","10/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","Last of the series, thank God","JRmf","'THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY - PART 2': Five Stars (Out of Five)The epic conclusion to the immensely popular sci-fi saga; based on the bestselling YA book series, of the same name, by Suzanne Collins. This forth installment, is the second movie based on the third (and final) book: 'Mockingjay'. In this chapter Katniss Everdeen plots to assassinate President Snow, while the rebels also wage war on the Capitol. It once again stars the always impressive Jennifer Lawrence, and it costars Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Julianne Moore, Sam Claflin, Natalie Dormer, Jena Malone, Willow Shields, Elizabeth Banks and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (all reprising roles from earlier films). Francis Lawrence returned to direct, for the third time, and Peter Craig and Danny Strong wrote the screenplay (they also co- wrote the last chapter). I think it's a beautiful, and stunning, conclusion to an epic film series (one of my favorites in recent years). The story picks up right where the last one left off, with Katniss (Lawrence) recovering from being attacked by a brainwashed Peeta (Hutcherson). The rebels attack District 2, and take over it's weapons supply. They then continue a bloody assault on the Capitol. Katniss volunteers to assassinate President Snow (Sutherland), but President Alma Coin (Moore) doesn't want to risk losing her as a symbol (for the revolution); if she were to be killed. Katniss, being Katniss, does what she wants to do anyway; and joins the rebel forces. She's teamed, in a rebel squad, with Gale (Hemsworth), Finnick (Claflin), Cressida (Dormer), Peeta and others; in shooting propaganda footage of the brutal war.I'm a big fan of the entire series, and this installment definitely doesn't disappoint. It's unrelentingly dark, disturbing and violent (I definitely think it should have been rated R). It's also completely epic and very moving (I let more than a few tears go). The end is perfectly fitting; and the political commentary is brutal and brilliant. I love Jennifer Lawrence, and she once again gives one of the best performances of the year; but the rest of the cast is decent as well, and I've really come to love all of these characters (especially Woody as Haymitch). For me it was just as exciting, emotional and fun, as the conclusions to any epic sci-fi film series; most notably 'THE RETURN OF THE KING'. It's definitely a 'must-see', and one of the best films of the year!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/wb45jfQumZ0","18 November 2015","3/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","Amazing ending to The Hunger Games.","mistoppi","It's tough to say goodbye, especially when doing so carries many different meanings at the same time – and has implications both on and off screen. ""The Hunger Games – Mockingjay, Part 2"" (PG-13, 2:17) is the final film from Suzanne Collins' blockbuster ""The Hunger Games"" YA book trilogy. So, we're saying goodbye (""possibly"" – more on that later) to this story and these characters in regards to our movie screens, and producers are saying goodbye to a film franchise that has become one of the top 20 in cinema history and whose films set box office records in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Within the action of this fourth film, the main characters have to say goodbye to others who survived the first three films, but don't make it through this one, while in real life, Movie Fans are saying final goodbyes to the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffman who died in early 2014 while filming this movie, making this his final film appearance. With so many real-life and character-related goodbyes involved with the ending of this series of movies, having a strong final film to enjoy would likely soften the blow. So, did we get it? Well The story quickly gets to the action and rarely lets up. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), the Hunger Games victor turned reluctant warrior has given way to a darker and more worldly (and world-weary) young woman who is anxious for an end to Panem's civil war – and obsessed with getting her revenge on the man whom she blames for it all – President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland). As determined as she is to accomplish her goals, Katniss must contend with Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), the leader of the rebellion, who doesn't always have Katniss' best interests at heart, Katniss' love interest, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who has been brainwashed by Snow's henchmen to want to kill her, and her best friend, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who's jealous of what Katniss and Peeta have or once had, or may have, or (If Katniss had Facebook, her relationship status would almost certainly be ""it's complicated"".) Katniss can be surly and isn't above going rogue, but she loves and feels deeply and has well-meaning supporters. Gale is there for her (as is Peeta, in his gradually increasing moments of clarity), and so is her sister Prim (Willow Shields), whom Katniss has always protected – at great personal risk (and whom Katniss could blame for the mess that has become her life, if you really think about it). Hunger Games mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), friend and stylist, Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), fellow Hunger Games veterans, Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) and Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin), Alma Coin's assistant, Plutarch Havensby (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and tough military commander, Boggs (Mahershala Ali), all try to help Katniss, but there's only so much that they can do. She has decided that she needs to kill President Snow – up close – regardless of whatever propaganda role she's being given or what potentially deadly obstacles (as in, sadistic booby traps) stand in her way. Ending the civil war is very personal to Katniss and she alone is uniquely able to do just that – if she can stay alive long enough.""The Hunger Games – Mockingjay, Part 2"" isn't game-changing, but it is a very strong, effective and entertaining end to ""The Hunger Games"" saga. Frances Lawrence, director of all but the first film, keeps screenwriters Peter Craig's and Danny Strong's story moving at a good pace and with some surprising twists. The action and visual effects are the best of the series and while there is a lot of violence, on both large and small scales, as with the other films, we are spared an excessive amount of gore in those moments. However, the movie does not skimp on its ever-present themes of the inherent ugliness of war and the difficult moral choices that those fighting war must face, and Katniss gives voice to both.The script is especially good in its discussion and depiction of war, but also in the changes it made from the book ""Mockingjay"". Purists may disagree with the changes, but they are suitably dramatic, give good closure to the story and maintain the spirit of the story's source material. The themes in the books are consistently and remarkably well portrayed in the films – especially this one. The same could be said for the actors' performances. Although this film means saying goodbye to this story, it may not necessarily mean saying goodbye to the general setting or some of the characters. There is some talk of a ""Hunger Games"" prequel or sequel. While we Movie Fans wait for the final word on those discussions, the last movie based on the original YA book trilogy gives us a lot to enjoy, to think about and to miss.

"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","I let more than a few tears go!","Hellmant","The four-toned call sounds through the distance, the three-fingered salute extending on the screen to unite a band of rebels in a dystopian era. No I've not gone crazy, I'm just talking about the latest Hollywood blockbuster. Yes my friends tonight we discuss the epic final chapter of the epic Jennifer Collins' masterpiece that you've been waiting a year for. Tonight I review Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2. If you remember my last review, you'll know I wasn't the biggest fan of the ""epic"" part 1 with its heavy dialogue and overdramatic songs. Part 2 was supposed to bring the explosive action with Collins dark edge of dystopian war. The good news is that Mockingjay part 2 definitely had more excitement than its predecessor, it just took a while to get there. Like the book, this installment had our heroes walking through the desecrated landscape, and commenting how bad things are. All the walking and talking made me feel like I was back in a Peter Jackson production, alleviated only by some heavy laden special effects that stimulated our cast to yes you guess it run. Eventually we get to some actual excitement that brings that familiar sense of heart pounding horror and displays our warriors skills outside of complaining, despite some shaky camera work in the beginning. After that the action is tempered down to a level many ""action"" fans will like. At this point you might be thinking, ""I don't come for the action. I come for the story, drama, and relationships this movie has."" Well the directors heard you and filled most of this 137 minute time span with these qualities, integrating them with all the walking. Much of the drama centers on Katniss' indecisiveness as to whom she loves, which is only distracted by her lingering hatred of Snow fueling her desire of revenge. The inner turmoil of our characters is brought to full life in these moments, but I wasn't emotionally stimulated in this movie at least not by the characters problems. Unfortunately they didn't add flare for other important moments in this movie, leaving them rather dull. Oh well, can't say they didn't make this somewhat realistic. Story wise this film sticks to the book closely, but the team has made some alterations to fill in the book's vague moments. Some moments add a little more glory to the extras, though the hype of the characters was greatly over exaggerated such as the best shooters unable to hit anything. In addition some of the alterations (especially those at the end) were not really needed and only dragged out the film further. Before you dislike the review hear me out. I get these scenes were to illustrate Katniss' time of healing as she accepts and copes with all that has transpired in the trilogy that the book fortunately glossed over. That didn't mean I wanted to see more bouts of overdramatic screaming (which I hadn't gotten enough of at this point) and verbal animal abuse. At least the epilogue was more fulfilling compared to what the book did.In terms of production quality, the movie is certainly impressive. Our film crew was able to design a war torn world that was savage and unforgiving, just like war. While I didn't feel for the characters in this movie, the cinematography certainly brings out the horrors of the Hunger Games. While the action wasn't what I had fully hoped for, the special effects are still an incredible visualization of Collins work, something truly worthy of the Game Masters especially those mutts. The added movie references, whether intentional or unintentional, were also a nice touch to maximize the darkness of this film. As for the acting, Jennifer Lawrence carries the torch as always. She plays Katniss as strongly as ever while still adding more depth to an already deep character, despite playing the same role she always plays (an angry woman). Josh Hutcherson surprisingly impressed me this time, managing to make Peta not as annoying as he was in the book. His portrayal of mentally disturbed was well done, and surprisingly kept in balance to make you feel for the guy. The other cast members did a great job (mostly), and fit well with each other to make a team, even if they took a back seat to the two leading roles. Mockingjay Part 2 ends the series on a good note. It stuck to the book fairly well, brought the world to life, and had impressive special effects. I can't say it's as action packed as everyone says, unless walking counts, but it still had an edge that got my heart pumping. It is definitely worth a visit to the theater, as if you would miss it, and I feel many fans will enjoy this fitting conclusion to the epic trilogy, or quadrilogy in this case. My scores for MockingJay are:Adventure: 8.0Movie overall: 7.0-7.5","20 November 2015","10/10",NA

"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","Amazing ending to The Hunger Games.","mistoppi","It's tough to say goodbye, especially when doing so carries many different meanings at the same time – and has implications both on and off screen. ""The Hunger Games – Mockingjay, Part 2"" (PG-13, 2:17) is the final film from Suzanne Collins' blockbuster ""The Hunger Games"" YA book trilogy. So, we're saying goodbye (""possibly"" – more on that later) to this story and these characters in regards to our movie screens, and producers are saying goodbye to a film franchise that has become one of the top 20 in cinema history and whose films set box office records in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Within the action of this fourth film, the main characters have to say goodbye to others who survived the first three films, but don't make it through this one, while in real life, Movie Fans are saying final goodbyes to the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffman who died in early 2014 while filming this movie, making this his final film appearance. With so many real-life and character-related goodbyes involved with the ending of this series of movies, having a strong final film to enjoy would likely soften the blow. So, did we get it? Well The story quickly gets to the action and rarely lets up. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), the Hunger Games victor turned reluctant warrior has given way to a darker and more worldly (and world-weary) young woman who is anxious for an end to Panem's civil war – and obsessed with getting her revenge on the man whom she blames for it all – President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland). As determined as she is to accomplish her goals, Katniss must contend with Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), the leader of the rebellion, who doesn't always have Katniss' best interests at heart, Katniss' love interest, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who has been brainwashed by Snow's henchmen to want to kill her, and her best friend, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who's jealous of what Katniss and Peeta have or once had, or may have, or (If Katniss had Facebook, her relationship status would almost certainly be ""it's complicated"".) Katniss can be surly and isn't above going rogue, but she loves and feels deeply and has well-meaning supporters. Gale is there for her (as is Peeta, in his gradually increasing moments of clarity), and so is her sister Prim (Willow Shields), whom Katniss has always protected – at great personal risk (and whom Katniss could blame for the mess that has become her life, if you really think about it). Hunger Games mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), friend and stylist, Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), fellow Hunger Games veterans, Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) and Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin), Alma Coin's assistant, Plutarch Havensby (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and tough military commander, Boggs (Mahershala Ali), all try to help Katniss, but there's only so much that they can do. She has decided that she needs to kill President Snow – up close – regardless of whatever propaganda role she's being given or what potentially deadly obstacles (as in, sadistic booby traps) stand in her way. Ending the civil war is very personal to Katniss and she alone is uniquely able to do just that – if she can stay alive long enough.""The Hunger Games – Mockingjay, Part 2"" isn't game-changing, but it is a very strong, effective and entertaining end to ""The Hunger Games"" saga. Frances Lawrence, director of all but the first film, keeps screenwriters Peter Craig's and Danny Strong's story moving at a good pace and with some surprising twists. The action and visual effects are the best of the series and while there is a lot of violence, on both large and small scales, as with the other films, we are spared an excessive amount of gore in those moments. However, the movie does not skimp on its ever-present themes of the inherent ugliness of war and the difficult moral choices that those fighting war must face, and Katniss gives voice to both.The script is especially good in its discussion and depiction of war, but also in the changes it made from the book ""Mockingjay"". Purists may disagree with the changes, but they are suitably dramatic, give good closure to the story and maintain the spirit of the story's source material. The themes in the books are consistently and remarkably well portrayed in the films – especially this one. The same could be said for the actors' performances. Although this film means saying goodbye to this story, it may not necessarily mean saying goodbye to the general setting or some of the characters. There is some talk of a ""Hunger Games"" prequel or sequel. While we Movie Fans wait for the final word on those discussions, the last movie based on the original YA book trilogy gives us a lot to enjoy, to think about and to miss.

"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","I let more than a few tears go!","Hellmant","The four-toned call sounds through the distance, the three-fingered salute extending on the screen to unite a band of rebels in a dystopian era. No I've not gone crazy, I'm just talking about the latest Hollywood blockbuster. Yes my friends tonight we discuss the epic final chapter of the epic Jennifer Collins' masterpiece that you've been waiting a year for. Tonight I review Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2. If you remember my last review, you'll know I wasn't the biggest fan of the ""epic"" part 1 with its heavy dialogue and overdramatic songs. Part 2 was supposed to bring the explosive action with Collins dark edge of dystopian war. The good news is that Mockingjay part 2 definitely had more excitement than its predecessor, it just took a while to get there. Like the book, this installment had our heroes walking through the desecrated landscape, and commenting how bad things are. All the walking and talking made me feel like I was back in a Peter Jackson production, alleviated only by some heavy laden special effects that stimulated our cast to yes you guess it run. Eventually we get to some actual excitement that brings that familiar sense of heart pounding horror and displays our warriors skills outside of complaining, despite some shaky camera work in the beginning. After that the action is tempered down to a level many ""action"" fans will like. At this point you might be thinking, ""I don't come for the action. I come for the story, drama, and relationships this movie has."" Well the directors heard you and filled most of this 137 minute time span with these qualities, integrating them with all the walking. Much of the drama centers on Katniss' indecisiveness as to whom she loves, which is only distracted by her lingering hatred of Snow fueling her desire of revenge. The inner turmoil of our characters is brought to full life in these moments, but I wasn't emotionally stimulated in this movie at least not by the characters problems. Unfortunately they didn't add flare for other important moments in this movie, leaving them rather dull. Oh well, can't say they didn't make this somewhat realistic. Story wise this film sticks to the book closely, but the team has made some alterations to fill in the book's vague moments. Some moments add a little more glory to the extras, though the hype of the characters was greatly over exaggerated such as the best shooters unable to hit anything. In addition some of the alterations (especially those at the end) were not really needed and only dragged out the film further. Before you dislike the review hear me out. I get these scenes were to illustrate Katniss' time of healing as she accepts and copes with all that has transpired in the trilogy that the book fortunately glossed over. That didn't mean I wanted to see more bouts of overdramatic screaming (which I hadn't gotten enough of at this point) and verbal animal abuse. At least the epilogue was more fulfilling compared to what the book did.In terms of production quality, the movie is certainly impressive. Our film crew was able to design a war torn world that was savage and unforgiving, just like war. While I didn't feel for the characters in this movie, the cinematography certainly brings out the horrors of the Hunger Games. While the action wasn't what I had fully hoped for, the special effects are still an incredible visualization of Collins work, something truly worthy of the Game Masters especially those mutts. The added movie references, whether intentional or unintentional, were also a nice touch to maximize the darkness of this film. As for the acting, Jennifer Lawrence carries the torch as always. She plays Katniss as strongly as ever while still adding more depth to an already deep character, despite playing the same role she always plays (an angry woman). Josh Hutcherson surprisingly impressed me this time, managing to make Peta not as annoying as he was in the book. His portrayal of mentally disturbed was well done, and surprisingly kept in balance to make you feel for the guy. The other cast members did a great job (mostly), and fit well with each other to make a team, even if they took a back seat to the two leading roles. Mockingjay Part 2 ends the series on a good note. It stuck to the book fairly well, brought the world to life, and had impressive special effects. I can't say it's as action packed as everyone says, unless walking counts, but it still had an edge that got my heart pumping. It is definitely worth a visit to the theater, as if you would miss it, and I feel many fans will enjoy this fitting conclusion to the epic trilogy, or quadrilogy in this case. My scores for MockingJay are:Adventure: 8.0Movie overall: 7.0-7.5","20 November 2015","10/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","Ends with a whimper rather than a bang.","BA_Harrison","Reluctant symbol of the revolution, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) leads a small group of freedom fighters into Panem to try and assassinate the wicked President Snow (Donald Sutherland).When they split Mockingjay into 2 parts, presumably for no other reason than financial gain, there was always the concern that the story would be far too drawn out (as with The Hobbit). And despite several decent action scenes (including booby-trap pods, a tidal wave of tar, and a mutt attack) that's precisely what has happened: at a whopping 137 minutes, this last film in the series feels like the proverbial dead horse has been well and truly flogged.I watched purely for the sake of completion, but at no point did I feel involved in the story or engaged with the characters. I just sat there waiting for the whole thing to end so I could move on to something else. A shame, because if they had taken the good bits from both Mockingjay movies and combined them into one (slightly longer) film, it might have been the best of the series and a fitting finalé for Katniss and co.","9 March 2016","5/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","Well padded","Prismark10","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a film without any artistic integrity. It was purely made to grab as much cash from its audience as possible. You can sense this in the film which does not have much of a plot, scenes that are purely filler and the story just crawls because the book that it is based on has been split into two which means more padding than a model wearing a Wonderbra.Panem is in chaos Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) plans to assassinate President Snow (Donald Sutherland.) Snow meanwhile wishes to spring a trap to finish off the rebels. Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is volatile as he turns his anger towards Katniss. Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) the leader of the rebels who plans to usurp Snow as President has her own agenda. You could say she and Snow are two sides of the same coin.Some of the action is humdrum and poorly lit and Katniss's use of the bow and arrow is almost laughable in this film. Given the first film in this franchise was a decent film, it has been disappointing to see the decline in quality to the sequels.","19 November 2017","3/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","Key events taking place off screen make for an awfully boring, bloated story","dierregi","Wow. I think this has got to be one of the most disappointing ending installments to a film series I've ever seen. The previous films build this installment up so much that you actually expect it to be the ultimate one of the 4-film series, with plenty of action, suspense, and drama, and given the way the previous films unfolded that expectation wouldn't be unwarranted. Unfortunately the exact opposite happened and instead of getting a really exciting & thrilling end film, we get a very slow, somewhat dull, melodramatic experience. I mean the first moment of any thrills is about 75 minutes in and yet only lasts for 10 minutes, and the thing is, those 10 minutes are the most exciting the film gets.I saw a couple of comments from people where they said this is ""Battle Royale II goes all Twilight"" and ""Battle Royale with cheese"" in describing this film and I think those are two perfect ways to sum this installment up, especially with the romance line and the way Kayniss went from Peeta to Gale then back again.After the completely over-hyped first installment, I found that the series was actually getting better, which was unexpected due to how lame the first film was. Catching Fire was MUCH better and blew the first film out the water. The third installment dipped a wee bit but was still decent enough and I thought it set everything up for a good climactic end film. I thought wrong because instead of a great climax it was more of a damp squib. Even the end scenes were about as exciting as a wet weekend in Grimsby. The whole film was just one big disappointment, especially given the build up from the previous three films and the whole ""revenge"" theme that was portrayed.If you want thrills you won't get it here. If you want action you'll need to look elsewhere. If you want a boring melodramatic Twilight type of film with some cheesy romantic undertones then this is for you.This is definitely not the ending I was hoping for.","9 May 2016","1/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","A Dull, Boring End To The Film Series","dfa120374","A commando unit is sent into the Capitol, now under siege, partially evacuated, overrun by refugees and entirely empty of glory and every bit splendor having faded to shades of grey. Their mission is to put an end to the tyranny. To assassinate President Snow(Sutherland, deliciously evil).There are entirely too many characters, and darlings that have been left alive, in the least critically trimmed of the four films - this feels strangely disconnected from the others. The production values, talent and scope on display fail to distract from that. As a final chapter, it's fair. Almost every single farewell feels flat and rushed. Essentially, no one has anything to do, not to mention that the new ones, thankfully largely undeveloped anyway, are utterly superfluous. Everyone in the love triangle do find themselves in extreme emotional situations, and certainly the still unstable and potentially homicidal Peeta makes for an immensely interesting element. But it is only with these three, and these two parts could and should have remained one three-hour picture.The themes are explored rather well, and this fits in an impressive amount of solidly done fiercely political, anti-war messages that are surprisingly relevant, considering it's all there in the book, which came out in 2010. It is clear that this wants to motivate for real-life campaigning to affect foreign policy, and one can only hope it does just that. Satire, clever writing and excitement yet again come through and elevate what might otherwise be ""good... for YA"" to a truly compelling piece that truly has something to say.There is a lot of brutal, disturbing violent content in this, pushing the PG-13 rating about as far as it can be. I recommend this to any fan of the series. 8/10","19 November 2015","4/10",NA

So, we're saying goodbye (""possibly"" – more on that later) to this story and these characters in regards to our movie screens, and producers are saying goodbye to a film franchise that has become one of the top 20 in cinema history and whose films set box office records in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Within the action of this fourth film, the main characters have to say goodbye to others who survived the first three films, but don't make it through this one, while in real life, Movie Fans are saying final goodbyes to the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffman who died in early 2014 while filming this movie, making this his final film appearance. With so many real-life and character-related goodbyes involved with the ending of this series of movies, having a strong final film to enjoy would likely soften the blow. So, did we get it? Well The story quickly gets to the action and rarely lets up. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), the Hunger Games victor turned reluctant warrior has given way to a darker and more worldly (and world-weary) young woman who is anxious for an end to Panem's civil war – and obsessed with getting her revenge on the man whom she blames for it all – President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland). As determined as she is to accomplish her goals, Katniss must contend with Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), the leader of the rebellion, who doesn't always have Katniss' best interests at heart, Katniss' love interest, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who has been brainwashed by Snow's henchmen to want to kill her, and her best friend, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who's jealous of what Katniss and Peeta have or once had, or may have, or (If Katniss had Facebook, her relationship status would almost certainly be ""it's complicated"".) Katniss can be surly and isn't above going rogue, but she loves and feels deeply and has well-meaning supporters. Gale is there for her (as is Peeta, in his gradually increasing moments of clarity), and so is her sister Prim (Willow Shields), whom Katniss has always protected – at great personal risk (and whom Katniss could blame for the mess that has become her life, if you really think about it). Hunger Games mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), friend and stylist, Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), fellow Hunger Games veterans, Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) and Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin), Alma Coin's assistant, Plutarch Havensby (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and tough military commander, Boggs (Mahershala Ali), all try to help Katniss, but there's only so much that they can do. She has decided that she needs to kill President Snow – up close – regardless of whatever propaganda role she's being given or what potentially deadly obstacles (as in, sadistic booby traps) stand in her way. Ending the civil war is very personal to Katniss and she alone is uniquely able to do just that – if she can stay alive long enough.""The Hunger Games – Mockingjay, Part 2"" isn't game-changing, but it is a very strong, effective and entertaining end to ""The Hunger Games"" saga. Frances Lawrence, director of all but the first film, keeps screenwriters Peter Craig's and Danny Strong's story moving at a good pace and with some surprising twists. The action and visual effects are the best of the series and while there is a lot of violence, on both large and small scales, as with the other films, we are spared an excessive amount of gore in those moments. However, the movie does not skimp on its ever-present themes of the inherent ugliness of war and the difficult moral choices that those fighting war must face, and Katniss gives voice to both.The script is especially good in its discussion and depiction of war, but also in the changes it made from the book ""Mockingjay"". Purists may disagree with the changes, but they are suitably dramatic, give good closure to the story and maintain the spirit of the story's source material. The themes in the books are consistently and remarkably well portrayed in the films – especially this one. The same could be said for the actors' performances. Although this film means saying goodbye to this story, it may not necessarily mean saying goodbye to the general setting or some of the characters. There is some talk of a ""Hunger Games"" prequel or sequel.

"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","I let more than a few tears go!","Hellmant","The four-toned call sounds through the distance, the three-fingered salute extending on the screen to unite a band of rebels in a dystopian era. No I've not gone crazy, I'm just talking about the latest Hollywood blockbuster. Yes my friends tonight we discuss the epic final chapter of the epic Jennifer Collins' masterpiece that you've been waiting a year for. Tonight I review Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2. If you remember my last review, you'll know I wasn't the biggest fan of the ""epic"" part 1 with its heavy dialogue and overdramatic songs. Part 2 was supposed to bring the explosive action with Collins dark edge of dystopian war. The good news is that Mockingjay part 2 definitely had more excitement than its predecessor, it just took a while to get there. Like the book, this installment had our heroes walking through the desecrated landscape, and commenting how bad things are. All the walking and talking made me feel like I was back in a Peter Jackson production, alleviated only by some heavy laden special effects that stimulated our cast to yes you guess it run. Eventually we get to some actual excitement that brings that familiar sense of heart pounding horror and displays our warriors skills outside of complaining, despite some shaky camera work in the beginning. After that the action is tempered down to a level many ""action"" fans will like. At this point you might be thinking, ""I don't come for the action. I come for the story, drama, and relationships this movie has."" Well the directors heard you and filled most of this 137 minute time span with these qualities, integrating them with all the walking. Much of the drama centers on Katniss' indecisiveness as to whom she loves, which is only distracted by her lingering hatred of Snow fueling her desire of revenge. The inner turmoil of our characters is brought to full life in these moments, but I wasn't emotionally stimulated in this movie at least not by the characters problems. Unfortunately they didn't add flare for other important moments in this movie, leaving them rather dull. Oh well, can't say they didn't make this somewhat realistic. Story wise this film sticks to the book closely, but the team has made some alterations to fill in the book's vague moments. Some moments add a little more glory to the extras, though the hype of the characters was greatly over exaggerated such as the best shooters unable to hit anything. In addition some of the alterations (especially those at the end) were not really needed and only dragged out the film further. Before you dislike the review hear me out. I get these scenes were to illustrate Katniss' time of healing as she accepts and copes with all that has transpired in the trilogy that the book fortunately glossed over. That didn't mean I wanted to see more bouts of overdramatic screaming (which I hadn't gotten enough of at this point) and verbal animal abuse. At least the epilogue was more fulfilling compared to what the book did.In terms of production quality, the movie is certainly impressive. Our film crew was able to design a war torn world that was savage and unforgiving, just like war. While I didn't feel for the characters in this movie, the cinematography certainly brings out the horrors of the Hunger Games. While the action wasn't what I had fully hoped for, the special effects are still an incredible visualization of Collins work, something truly worthy of the Game Masters especially those mutts. The added movie references, whether intentional or unintentional, were also a nice touch to maximize the darkness of this film. As for the acting, Jennifer Lawrence carries the torch as always. She plays Katniss as strongly as ever while still adding more depth to an already deep character, despite playing the same role she always plays (an angry woman). Josh Hutcherson surprisingly impressed me this time, managing to make Peta not as annoying as he was in the book. His portrayal of mentally disturbed was well done, and surprisingly kept in balance to make you feel for the guy. The other cast members did a great job (mostly), and fit well with each other to make a team, even if they took a back seat to the two leading roles. Mockingjay Part 2 ends the series on a good note. It stuck to the book fairly well, brought the world to life, and had impressive special effects. I can't say it's as action packed as everyone says, unless walking counts, but it still had an edge that got my heart pumping. It is definitely worth a visit to the theater, as if you would miss it, and I feel many fans will enjoy this fitting conclusion to the epic trilogy, or quadrilogy in this case. My scores for MockingJay are:Adventure: 8.0Movie overall: 7.0-7.5","20 November 2015","10/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","Ends with a whimper rather than a bang.","BA_Harrison","Reluctant symbol of the revolution, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) leads a small group of freedom fighters into Panem to try and assassinate the wicked President Snow (Donald Sutherland).When they split Mockingjay into 2 parts, presumably for no other reason than financial gain, there was always the concern that the story would be far too drawn out (as with The Hobbit). And despite several decent action scenes (including booby-trap pods, a tidal wave of tar, and a mutt attack) that's precisely what has happened: at a whopping 137 minutes, this last film in the series feels like the proverbial dead horse has been well and truly flogged.I watched purely for the sake of completion, but at no point did I feel involved in the story or engaged with the characters. I just sat there waiting for the whole thing to end so I could move on to something else. A shame, because if they had taken the good bits from both Mockingjay movies and combined them into one (slightly longer) film, it might have been the best of the series and a fitting finalé for Katniss and co.","9 March 2016","5/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","Well padded","Prismark10","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a film without any artistic integrity. It was purely made to grab as much cash from its audience as possible. You can sense this in the film which does not have much of a plot, scenes that are purely filler and the story just crawls because the book that it is based on has been split into two which means more padding than a model wearing a Wonderbra.Panem is in chaos Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) plans to assassinate President Snow (Donald Sutherland.) Snow meanwhile wishes to spring a trap to finish off the rebels. Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is volatile as he turns his anger towards Katniss. Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) the leader of the rebels who plans to usurp Snow as President has her own agenda. You could say she and Snow are two sides of the same coin.Some of the action is humdrum and poorly lit and Katniss's use of the bow and arrow is almost laughable in this film. Given the first film in this franchise was a decent film, it has been disappointing to see the decline in quality to the sequels.","19 November 2017","3/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","Key events taking place off screen make for an awfully boring, bloated story","dierregi","Wow. I think this has got to be one of the most disappointing ending installments to a film series I've ever seen. The previous films build this installment up so much that you actually expect it to be the ultimate one of the 4-film series, with plenty of action, suspense, and drama, and given the way the previous films unfolded that expectation wouldn't be unwarranted. Unfortunately the exact opposite happened and instead of getting a really exciting & thrilling end film, we get a very slow, somewhat dull, melodramatic experience. I mean the first moment of any thrills is about 75 minutes in and yet only lasts for 10 minutes, and the thing is, those 10 minutes are the most exciting the film gets.I saw a couple of comments from people where they said this is ""Battle Royale II goes all Twilight"" and ""Battle Royale with cheese"" in describing this film and I think those are two perfect ways to sum this installment up, especially with the romance line and the way Kayniss went from Peeta to Gale then back again.After the completely over-hyped first installment, I found that the series was actually getting better, which was unexpected due to how lame the first film was. Catching Fire was MUCH better and blew the first film out the water. The third installment dipped a wee bit but was still decent enough and I thought it set everything up for a good climactic end film. I thought wrong because instead of a great climax it was more of a damp squib. Even the end scenes were about as exciting as a wet weekend in Grimsby. The whole film was just one big disappointment, especially given the build up from the previous three films and the whole ""revenge"" theme that was portrayed.If you want thrills you won't get it here. If you want action you'll need to look elsewhere. If you want a boring melodramatic Twilight type of film with some cheesy romantic undertones then this is for you.This is definitely not the ending I was hoping for.","9 May 2016","1/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","A Dull, Boring End To The Film Series","dfa120374","A commando unit is sent into the Capitol, now under siege, partially evacuated, overrun by refugees and entirely empty of glory and every bit splendor having faded to shades of grey. Their mission is to put an end to the tyranny. To assassinate President Snow(Sutherland, deliciously evil).There are entirely too many characters, and darlings that have been left alive, in the least critically trimmed of the four films - this feels strangely disconnected from the others. The production values, talent and scope on display fail to distract from that. As a final chapter, it's fair. Almost every single farewell feels flat and rushed. Essentially, no one has anything to do, not to mention that the new ones, thankfully largely undeveloped anyway, are utterly superfluous. Everyone in the love triangle do find themselves in extreme emotional situations, and certainly the still unstable and potentially homicidal Peeta makes for an immensely interesting element. But it is only with these three, and these two parts could and should have remained one three-hour picture.The themes are explored rather well, and this fits in an impressive amount of solidly done fiercely political, anti-war messages that are surprisingly relevant, considering it's all there in the book, which came out in 2010. It is clear that this wants to motivate for real-life campaigning to affect foreign policy, and one can only hope it does just that. Satire, clever writing and excitement yet again come through and elevate what might otherwise be ""good... for YA"" to a truly compelling piece that truly has something to say.There is a lot of brutal, disturbing violent content in this, pushing the PG-13 rating about as far as it can be. I recommend this to any fan of the series. 8/10","19 November 2015","4/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","The temperature shifts many times, not always appropriately","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 concludes the adventures of Katniss Everdeen(Jennifer Lawrence). After the events of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1(2014), Katniss, Peeta Mellark(Josh Hutcherson), Gale Hawthorne(Liam Hemsworth), Finnick Odair(Sam Claflin), Boggs(Mahershala Ali), Cressida(Natalie Dormer) & the rest of the Rebels will have to take down President Snow(Donald Sutherland) & the evil Capitol, once & for all. As the war of Panem spirals out of control, & the Capitol attacks any district that opposes them, Katniss' life & the lives of her allies & loved ones are at risk. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a fantastic film. It is a satisfying & emotional end to The Hunger Games series. All the action set pieces are top notch. The special effects are superb. The underground set piece is one of the highlights of the film. Don't worry though. This film is not just a mishmash of action scenes. There are plenty of heart touching moments too. This movie takes all the best aspects from The Hunger Games(2012), The Hunger Games: Catching Fire(2013) & The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1(2014), to become my favorite film in the franchise. There are so many twists & turns in the film that will keep you guessing right till the end(if you haven't read the books, of course). The suspense factor is a welcome addition, that didn't feature in the previous three films. A minor flaw would be the 3D. Although it works in a few scenes, overall the 3D is unnecessary. Just watch the movie in 2D, if you have an option. Director Francis Lawrence has given fans a perfect end to The Hunger Games movies. Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding as Katniss Everdeen. Josh Hutcherson is spectacular as Peeta Mellark. Liam Hemsworth is brilliant as Gale Hawthorne. Woody Harrelson is awesome as Haymitch Abernathy. Donald Sutherland is menacing as President Snow. Philip Seymour Hoffman is good as Plutarch Heavensbee. Julianne Moore is great as President Alma Coin. Willow Shields is impressive as Primrose Everdeen. Sam Claflin is superb as Finnick Odair. Mahershala Ali, Jeffrey Wright & Jena Malone are effective as Boggs, Beetee & Johanna Mason respectively. Stanley Tucci & Elizabeth Banks are super as Caesar Flickerman & Effie Trinket respectively. Natalie Dormer & Elden Hensen are awesome as Cressida & Pollux respectively. The supporting cast are great as well. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a must watch.","20 November 2015","8/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","The series finishes strongly","neil-476","Slow-paced, navel-gazing, clock-watching, struggling to stay awake - give me back those 2¼ hrs... Anytime an action sequence started (only a few times) it was quickly curtailed and drowned in a dark/black scene, much of the movie is introspection / hand-wringing and dark-dark-dark. I hate movies with a lot of blackness and you can't see what is supposed to be represented on the screen..This was certainly a disappointment following the earlier episodes of the series. Maybe it made sense to keen followers of the books, but heaven help someone who wandered in off the street drawn in by fancy advertising featuring a dynamic, sexy Katniss, and expecting an engrossing thriller.. {yawn}The ""execution"" where Katniss shoots Coin was not entirely unexpected. If I have been Coin I would have been primed to duck, but apparently she was too dumb for that. Nasty way for Snow to die, ripped apart by the Mob, surely Katniss could have dispatched him with a 2nd arrow.. or maybe she had a hidden sadistic streak..So Katniss' fate was to be a Mum/housewife but looks like she already had Peeta well trained..","28 November 2015","9/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","A fitting finale to The Hunger Games franchise.","Anurag-Shetty","I love The Hunger Games trilogy mostly because it is so dark and brutal, and even if Katniss does what she has to do, she still suffers from everything that has happened. In a badly written version of the novels Katniss would behave like nothing ever bothered her, which would make her just seem violent and rash. When we know everything has gotten to her, we know what she is sensitive, we know that everything has actually touched her. The most horrifying thing is when you realise how young Katniss actually is. The original point of the novel series was how kids were forced to fight in the arena, and how a kid actually became the most important person to the resistance. Think about when you were 17, would you have been able to unite people against your oppressors? That's a really horrifying thought - and that was the point Collins was trying to make. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent as Katniss. She portrays her social clumsiness well, but also her emotional weaknesses and her bravery. She's a great actress, but there should've been someone else playing her, someone younger (and Native), because then it would look as terrifying at it was meant to.Not all the events from the novel were included in the Mockingjay part 1 or 2. It's understandable especially when it comes to the part 2. For example, Katniss, Finnick, Johanna and Peeta being trained for the war? It would take too much time to show everything, considering how long the film already was.Some people are complaining about how they should've made the Mockingjay into a one film. I disagree. It is one film, but in two parts. And it works this way, because the second part starts so well - it starts exactly where it should start considering what happened in the end of Part 1. It works as two parts, and there was no need to wrap the story up any more. It was very dense already - things happen quickly but there is still time for important dialogue.The music in these films is almost unreal because of how beautiful it is - and it still is astonishing in the last one.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 2 is dark and brutal, but it has hope, some amazing hope that after all that darkness makes everything better. It's an amazing finale for the best young adult science fiction stories I have read or seen.I feel weird that it's all over now. Suzanne Collins has created amazing characters who were portrayed so well over the years - or left out, as the case may be. Thanks for the ride, it has been amazing.","9 April 2016","10/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","Last of the series, thank God","JRmf","'THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY - PART 2': Five Stars (Out of Five)The epic conclusion to the immensely popular sci-fi saga; based on the bestselling YA book series, of the same name, by Suzanne Collins. This forth installment, is the second movie based on the third (and final) book: 'Mockingjay'. In this chapter Katniss Everdeen plots to assassinate President Snow, while the rebels also wage war on the Capitol. It once again stars the always impressive Jennifer Lawrence, and it costars Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Julianne Moore, Sam Claflin, Natalie Dormer, Jena Malone, Willow Shields, Elizabeth Banks and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (all reprising roles from earlier films). Francis Lawrence returned to direct, for the third time, and Peter Craig and Danny Strong wrote the screenplay (they also co- wrote the last chapter). I think it's a beautiful, and stunning, conclusion to an epic film series (one of my favorites in recent years). The story picks up right where the last one left off, with Katniss (Lawrence) recovering from being attacked by a brainwashed Peeta (Hutcherson). The rebels attack District 2, and take over it's weapons supply. They then continue a bloody assault on the Capitol. Katniss volunteers to assassinate President Snow (Sutherland), but President Alma Coin (Moore) doesn't want to risk losing her as a symbol (for the revolution); if she were to be killed. Katniss, being Katniss, does what she wants to do anyway; and joins the rebel forces. She's teamed, in a rebel squad, with Gale (Hemsworth), Finnick (Claflin), Cressida (Dormer), Peeta and others; in shooting propaganda footage of the brutal war.I'm a big fan of the entire series, and this installment definitely doesn't disappoint. It's unrelentingly dark, disturbing and violent (I definitely think it should have been rated R). It's also completely epic and very moving (I let more than a few tears go). The end is perfectly fitting; and the political commentary is brutal and brilliant. I love Jennifer Lawrence, and she once again gives one of the best performances of the year; but the rest of the cast is decent as well, and I've really come to love all of these characters (especially Woody as Haymitch). For me it was just as exciting, emotional and fun, as the conclusions to any epic sci-fi film series; most notably 'THE RETURN OF THE KING'. It's definitely a 'must-see', and one of the best films of the year!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/wb45jfQumZ0","18 November 2015","3/10",NA

"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","Ends with a whimper rather than a bang.","BA_Harrison","Reluctant symbol of the revolution, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) leads a small group of freedom fighters into Panem to try and assassinate the wicked President Snow (Donald Sutherland).When they split Mockingjay into 2 parts, presumably for no other reason than financial gain, there was always the concern that the story would be far too drawn out (as with The Hobbit). And despite several decent action scenes (including booby-trap pods, a tidal wave of tar, and a mutt attack) that's precisely what has happened: at a whopping 137 minutes, this last film in the series feels like the proverbial dead horse has been well and truly flogged.I watched purely for the sake of completion, but at no point did I feel involved in the story or engaged with the characters. I just sat there waiting for the whole thing to end so I could move on to something else. A shame, because if they had taken the good bits from both Mockingjay movies and combined them into one (slightly longer) film, it might have been the best of the series and a fitting finalé for Katniss and co.","9 March 2016","5/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","Well padded","Prismark10","The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a film without any artistic integrity. It was purely made to grab as much cash from its audience as possible. You can sense this in the film which does not have much of a plot, scenes that are purely filler and the story just crawls because the book that it is based on has been split into two which means more padding than a model wearing a Wonderbra.Panem is in chaos Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) plans to assassinate President Snow (Donald Sutherland.) Snow meanwhile wishes to spring a trap to finish off the rebels. Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is volatile as he turns his anger towards Katniss. Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) the leader of the rebels who plans to usurp Snow as President has her own agenda. You could say she and Snow are two sides of the same coin.Some of the action is humdrum and poorly lit and Katniss's use of the bow and arrow is almost laughable in this film. Given the first film in this franchise was a decent film, it has been disappointing to see the decline in quality to the sequels.","19 November 2017","3/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","Key events taking place off screen make for an awfully boring, bloated story","dierregi","Wow. I think this has got to be one of the most disappointing ending installments to a film series I've ever seen. The previous films build this installment up so much that you actually expect it to be the ultimate one of the 4-film series, with plenty of action, suspense, and drama, and given the way the previous films unfolded that expectation wouldn't be unwarranted. Unfortunately the exact opposite happened and instead of getting a really exciting & thrilling end film, we get a very slow, somewhat dull, melodramatic experience. I mean the first moment of any thrills is about 75 minutes in and yet only lasts for 10 minutes, and the thing is, those 10 minutes are the most exciting the film gets.I saw a couple of comments from people where they said this is ""Battle Royale II goes all Twilight"" and ""Battle Royale with cheese"" in describing this film and I think those are two perfect ways to sum this installment up, especially with the romance line and the way Kayniss went from Peeta to Gale then back again.After the completely over-hyped first installment, I found that the series was actually getting better, which was unexpected due to how lame the first film was. Catching Fire was MUCH better and blew the first film out the water. The third installment dipped a wee bit but was still decent enough and I thought it set everything up for a good climactic end film. I thought wrong because instead of a great climax it was more of a damp squib. Even the end scenes were about as exciting as a wet weekend in Grimsby. The whole film was just one big disappointment, especially given the build up from the previous three films and the whole ""revenge"" theme that was portrayed.If you want thrills you won't get it here. If you want action you'll need to look elsewhere. If you want a boring melodramatic Twilight type of film with some cheesy romantic undertones then this is for you.This is definitely not the ending I was hoping for.","9 May 2016","1/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","A Dull, Boring End To The Film Series","dfa120374","A commando unit is sent into the Capitol, now under siege, partially evacuated, overrun by refugees and entirely empty of glory and every bit splendor having faded to shades of grey. Their mission is to put an end to the tyranny. To assassinate President Snow(Sutherland, deliciously evil).There are entirely too many characters, and darlings that have been left alive, in the least critically trimmed of the four films - this feels strangely disconnected from the others. The production values, talent and scope on display fail to distract from that. As a final chapter, it's fair. Almost every single farewell feels flat and rushed. Essentially, no one has anything to do, not to mention that the new ones, thankfully largely undeveloped anyway, are utterly superfluous. Everyone in the love triangle do find themselves in extreme emotional situations, and certainly the still unstable and potentially homicidal Peeta makes for an immensely interesting element. But it is only with these three, and these two parts could and should have remained one three-hour picture.The themes are explored rather well, and this fits in an impressive amount of solidly done fiercely political, anti-war messages that are surprisingly relevant, considering it's all there in the book, which came out in 2010. It is clear that this wants to motivate for real-life campaigning to affect foreign policy, and one can only hope it does just that. Satire, clever writing and excitement yet again come through and elevate what might otherwise be ""good... for YA"" to a truly compelling piece that truly has something to say.There is a lot of brutal, disturbing violent content in this, pushing the PG-13 rating about as far as it can be. I recommend this to any fan of the series. 8/10","19 November 2015","4/10",NA

After the events of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1(2014), Katniss, Peeta Mellark(Josh Hutcherson), Gale Hawthorne(Liam Hemsworth), Finnick Odair(Sam Claflin), Boggs(Mahershala Ali), Cressida(Natalie Dormer) & the rest of the Rebels will have to take down President Snow(Donald Sutherland) & the evil Capitol, once & for all. As the war of Panem spirals out of control, & the Capitol attacks any district that opposes them, Katniss' life & the lives of her allies & loved ones are at risk. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a fantastic film. It is a satisfying & emotional end to The Hunger Games series. All the action set pieces are top notch. The special effects are superb. The underground set piece is one of the highlights of the film. Don't worry though. This film is not just a mishmash of action scenes. There are plenty of heart touching moments too. This movie takes all the best aspects from The Hunger Games(2012), The Hunger Games: Catching Fire(2013) & The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1(2014), to become my favorite film in the franchise. There are so many twists & turns in the film that will keep you guessing right till the end(if you haven't read the books, of course). The suspense factor is a welcome addition, that didn't feature in the previous three films. A minor flaw would be the 3D. Although it works in a few scenes, overall the 3D is unnecessary. Just watch the movie in 2D, if you have an option. Director Francis Lawrence has given fans a perfect end to The Hunger Games movies. Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding as Katniss Everdeen. Josh Hutcherson is spectacular as Peeta Mellark. Liam Hemsworth is brilliant as Gale Hawthorne. Woody Harrelson is awesome as Haymitch Abernathy. Donald Sutherland is menacing as President Snow. Philip Seymour Hoffman is good as Plutarch Heavensbee. Julianne Moore is great as President Alma Coin. Willow Shields is impressive as Primrose Everdeen. Sam Claflin is superb as Finnick Odair. Mahershala Ali, Jeffrey Wright & Jena Malone are effective as Boggs, Beetee & Johanna Mason respectively. Stanley Tucci & Elizabeth Banks are super as Caesar Flickerman & Effie Trinket respectively. Natalie Dormer & Elden Hensen are awesome as Cressida & Pollux respectively. The supporting cast are great as well.

"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","The series finishes strongly","neil-476","Slow-paced, navel-gazing, clock-watching, struggling to stay awake - give me back those 2¼ hrs... Anytime an action sequence started (only a few times) it was quickly curtailed and drowned in a dark/black scene, much of the movie is introspection / hand-wringing and dark-dark-dark. I hate movies with a lot of blackness and you can't see what is supposed to be represented on the screen..This was certainly a disappointment following the earlier episodes of the series. Maybe it made sense to keen followers of the books, but heaven help someone who wandered in off the street drawn in by fancy advertising featuring a dynamic, sexy Katniss, and expecting an engrossing thriller.. {yawn}The ""execution"" where Katniss shoots Coin was not entirely unexpected. If I have been Coin I would have been primed to duck, but apparently she was too dumb for that. Nasty way for Snow to die, ripped apart by the Mob, surely Katniss could have dispatched him with a 2nd arrow.. or maybe she had a hidden sadistic streak..So Katniss' fate was to be a Mum/housewife but looks like she already had Peeta well trained..","28 November 2015","9/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","A fitting finale to The Hunger Games franchise.","Anurag-Shetty","I love The Hunger Games trilogy mostly because it is so dark and brutal, and even if Katniss does what she has to do, she still suffers from everything that has happened. In a badly written version of the novels Katniss would behave like nothing ever bothered her, which would make her just seem violent and rash. When we know everything has gotten to her, we know what she is sensitive, we know that everything has actually touched her. The most horrifying thing is when you realise how young Katniss actually is. The original point of the novel series was how kids were forced to fight in the arena, and how a kid actually became the most important person to the resistance. Think about when you were 17, would you have been able to unite people against your oppressors? That's a really horrifying thought - and that was the point Collins was trying to make. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent as Katniss. She portrays her social clumsiness well, but also her emotional weaknesses and her bravery. She's a great actress, but there should've been someone else playing her, someone younger (and Native), because then it would look as terrifying at it was meant to.Not all the events from the novel were included in the Mockingjay part 1 or 2. It's understandable especially when it comes to the part 2. For example, Katniss, Finnick, Johanna and Peeta being trained for the war? It would take too much time to show everything, considering how long the film already was.Some people are complaining about how they should've made the Mockingjay into a one film. I disagree. It is one film, but in two parts. And it works this way, because the second part starts so well - it starts exactly where it should start considering what happened in the end of Part 1. It works as two parts, and there was no need to wrap the story up any more. It was very dense already - things happen quickly but there is still time for important dialogue.The music in these films is almost unreal because of how beautiful it is - and it still is astonishing in the last one.The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 2 is dark and brutal, but it has hope, some amazing hope that after all that darkness makes everything better. It's an amazing finale for the best young adult science fiction stories I have read or seen.I feel weird that it's all over now. Suzanne Collins has created amazing characters who were portrayed so well over the years - or left out, as the case may be. Thanks for the ride, it has been amazing.","9 April 2016","10/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","Last of the series, thank God","JRmf","'THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY - PART 2': Five Stars (Out of Five)The epic conclusion to the immensely popular sci-fi saga; based on the bestselling YA book series, of the same name, by Suzanne Collins. This forth installment, is the second movie based on the third (and final) book: 'Mockingjay'. In this chapter Katniss Everdeen plots to assassinate President Snow, while the rebels also wage war on the Capitol. It once again stars the always impressive Jennifer Lawrence, and it costars Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Julianne Moore, Sam Claflin, Natalie Dormer, Jena Malone, Willow Shields, Elizabeth Banks and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (all reprising roles from earlier films). Francis Lawrence returned to direct, for the third time, and Peter Craig and Danny Strong wrote the screenplay (they also co- wrote the last chapter). I think it's a beautiful, and stunning, conclusion to an epic film series (one of my favorites in recent years). The story picks up right where the last one left off, with Katniss (Lawrence) recovering from being attacked by a brainwashed Peeta (Hutcherson). The rebels attack District 2, and take over it's weapons supply. They then continue a bloody assault on the Capitol. Katniss volunteers to assassinate President Snow (Sutherland), but President Alma Coin (Moore) doesn't want to risk losing her as a symbol (for the revolution); if she were to be killed. Katniss, being Katniss, does what she wants to do anyway; and joins the rebel forces. She's teamed, in a rebel squad, with Gale (Hemsworth), Finnick (Claflin), Cressida (Dormer), Peeta and others; in shooting propaganda footage of the brutal war.I'm a big fan of the entire series, and this installment definitely doesn't disappoint. It's unrelentingly dark, disturbing and violent (I definitely think it should have been rated R). It's also completely epic and very moving (I let more than a few tears go). The end is perfectly fitting; and the political commentary is brutal and brilliant. I love Jennifer Lawrence, and she once again gives one of the best performances of the year; but the rest of the cast is decent as well, and I've really come to love all of these characters (especially Woody as Haymitch). For me it was just as exciting, emotional and fun, as the conclusions to any epic sci-fi film series; most notably 'THE RETURN OF THE KING'. It's definitely a 'must-see', and one of the best films of the year!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/wb45jfQumZ0","18 November 2015","3/10",NA
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","Amazing ending to The Hunger Games.","mistoppi","It's tough to say goodbye, especially when doing so carries many different meanings at the same time – and has implications both on and off screen. ""The Hunger Games – Mockingjay, Part 2"" (PG-13, 2:17) is the final film from Suzanne Collins' blockbuster ""The Hunger Games"" YA book trilogy. So, we're saying goodbye (""possibly"" – more on that later) to this story and these characters in regards to our movie screens, and producers are saying goodbye to a film franchise that has become one of the top 20 in cinema history and whose films set box office records in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Within the action of this fourth film, the main characters have to say goodbye to others who survived the first three films, but don't make it through this one, while in real life, Movie Fans are saying final goodbyes to the late, great Philip Seymour Hoffman who died in early 2014 while filming this movie, making this his final film appearance. With so many real-life and character-related goodbyes involved with the ending of this series of movies, having a strong final film to enjoy would likely soften the blow. So, did we get it? Well The story quickly gets to the action and rarely lets up. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), the Hunger Games victor turned reluctant warrior has given way to a darker and more worldly (and world-weary) young woman who is anxious for an end to Panem's civil war – and obsessed with getting her revenge on the man whom she blames for it all – President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland). As determined as she is to accomplish her goals, Katniss must contend with Alma Coin (Julianne Moore), the leader of the rebellion, who doesn't always have Katniss' best interests at heart, Katniss' love interest, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who has been brainwashed by Snow's henchmen to want to kill her, and her best friend, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who's jealous of what Katniss and Peeta have or once had, or may have, or (If Katniss had Facebook, her relationship status would almost certainly be ""it's complicated"".) Katniss can be surly and isn't above going rogue, but she loves and feels deeply and has well-meaning supporters. Gale is there for her (as is Peeta, in his gradually increasing moments of clarity), and so is her sister Prim (Willow Shields), whom Katniss has always protected – at great personal risk (and whom Katniss could blame for the mess that has become her life, if you really think about it). Hunger Games mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), friend and stylist, Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), fellow Hunger Games veterans, Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) and Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin), Alma Coin's assistant, Plutarch Havensby (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and tough military commander, Boggs (Mahershala Ali), all try to help Katniss, but there's only so much that they can do. She has decided that she needs to kill President Snow – up close – regardless of whatever propaganda role she's being given or what potentially deadly obstacles (as in, sadistic booby traps) stand in her way. Ending the civil war is very personal to Katniss and she alone is uniquely able to do just that – if she can stay alive long enough.""The Hunger Games – Mockingjay, Part 2"" isn't game-changing, but it is a very strong, effective and entertaining end to ""The Hunger Games"" saga. Frances Lawrence, director of all but the first film, keeps screenwriters Peter Craig's and Danny Strong's story moving at a good pace and with some surprising twists. The action and visual effects are the best of the series and while there is a lot of violence, on both large and small scales, as with the other films, we are spared an excessive amount of gore in those moments. However, the movie does not skimp on its ever-present themes of the inherent ugliness of war and the difficult moral choices that those fighting war must face, and Katniss gives voice to both.The script is especially good in its discussion and depiction of war, but also in the changes it made from the book ""Mockingjay"". Purists may disagree with the changes, but they are suitably dramatic, give good closure to the story and maintain the spirit of the story's source material. The themes in the books are consistently and remarkably well portrayed in the films – especially this one. The same could be said for the actors' performances. Although this film means saying goodbye to this story, it may not necessarily mean saying goodbye to the general setting or some of the characters. There is some talk of a ""Hunger Games"" prequel or sequel. While we Movie Fans wait for the final word on those discussions, the last movie based on the original YA book trilogy gives us a lot to enjoy, to think about and to miss.

"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015)","I let more than a few tears go!","Hellmant","The four-toned call sounds through the distance, the three-fingered salute extending on the screen to unite a band of rebels in a dystopian era. No I've not gone crazy, I'm just talking about the latest Hollywood blockbuster. Yes my friends tonight we discuss the epic final chapter of the epic Jennifer Collins' masterpiece that you've been waiting a year for. Tonight I review Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2. If you remember my last review, you'll know I wasn't the biggest fan of the ""epic"" part 1 with its heavy dialogue and overdramatic songs. Part 2 was supposed to bring the explosive action with Collins dark edge of dystopian war. The good news is that Mockingjay part 2 definitely had more excitement than its predecessor, it just took a while to get there. Like the book, this installment had our heroes walking through the desecrated landscape, and commenting how bad things are. All the walking and talking made me feel like I was back in a Peter Jackson production, alleviated only by some heavy laden special effects that stimulated our cast to yes you guess it run. Eventually we get to some actual excitement that brings that familiar sense of heart pounding horror and displays our warriors skills outside of complaining, despite some shaky camera work in the beginning. After that the action is tempered down to a level many ""action"" fans will like. At this point you might be thinking, ""I don't come for the action. I come for the story, drama, and relationships this movie has."" Well the directors heard you and filled most of this 137 minute time span with these qualities, integrating them with all the walking. Much of the drama centers on Katniss' indecisiveness as to whom she loves, which is only distracted by her lingering hatred of Snow fueling her desire of revenge. The inner turmoil of our characters is brought to full life in these moments, but I wasn't emotionally stimulated in this movie at least not by the characters problems. Unfortunately they didn't add flare for other important moments in this movie, leaving them rather dull. Oh well, can't say they didn't make this somewhat realistic. Story wise this film sticks to the book closely, but the team has made some alterations to fill in the book's vague moments. Some moments add a little more glory to the extras, though the hype of the characters was greatly over exaggerated such as the best shooters unable to hit anything. In addition some of the alterations (especially those at the end) were not really needed and only dragged out the film further. Before you dislike the review hear me out. I get these scenes were to illustrate Katniss' time of healing as she accepts and copes with all that has transpired in the trilogy that the book fortunately glossed over. That didn't mean I wanted to see more bouts of overdramatic screaming (which I hadn't gotten enough of at this point) and verbal animal abuse. At least the epilogue was more fulfilling compared to what the book did.In terms of production quality, the movie is certainly impressive. Our film crew was able to design a war torn world that was savage and unforgiving, just like war. While I didn't feel for the characters in this movie, the cinematography certainly brings out the horrors of the Hunger Games. While the action wasn't what I had fully hoped for, the special effects are still an incredible visualization of Collins work, something truly worthy of the Game Masters especially those mutts. The added movie references, whether intentional or unintentional, were also a nice touch to maximize the darkness of this film. As for the acting, Jennifer Lawrence carries the torch as always. She plays Katniss as strongly as ever while still adding more depth to an already deep character, despite playing the same role she always plays (an angry woman). Josh Hutcherson surprisingly impressed me this time, managing to make Peta not as annoying as he was in the book. His portrayal of mentally disturbed was well done, and surprisingly kept in balance to make you feel for the guy. The other cast members did a great job (mostly), and fit well with each other to make a team, even if they took a back seat to the two leading roles. Mockingjay Part 2 ends the series on a good note. It stuck to the book fairly well, brought the world to life, and had impressive special effects. I can't say it's as action packed as everyone says, unless walking counts, but it still had an edge that got my heart pumping. It is definitely worth a visit to the theater, as if you would miss it, and I feel many fans will enjoy this fitting conclusion to the epic trilogy, or quadrilogy in this case. My scores for MockingJay are:Adventure: 8.0Movie overall: 7.0-7.5","20 November 2015","10/10",NA
"El Conde (2023)","Great merits, but the film had the potential to be much better","guisreis","It is a strange film which is hard to fit any label or classification. It has great merits, but still disappointed my expectations. It also travels through multiple genres not fitting well any of them, for better or worse: gore horror, dark humour comedy, political satire, and even political thriller. Visually, the movie is very nice and Pinochet's portrayal is astonishing (how similar with the military devil makeup turned Jaime Vadell!). I loved all the vampire origin stories in Ancien Régime. It was also quite good to have a timeline drawn through Haiti, Cuba, Russia (Pinoche always against the revolutionaires)... it would be great if it were more explored indeed. The bad character of all members of the family and of the torturer butler was well depicted. However, the film also has serious drawbacks. The script is unbalanced and should have been tighter. Pace is irregular, alternating awesome moments with quite sluggish parts. The behaviour of the characters seemed too inconsistent too, being hard to understand their motivations, and not because they were deceiving them. The interviews by the exorcist nun were slightlty unconvincing as sonething to actually happen, but they did allow the script to mock and denounce a lot the multiple crimes (from corruption to murder) of Pinochet's family and their impunity.","16 September 2023","7/10",NA
"El Conde (2023)","A Dark Satire","Pairic","El Conde: Pinochet as a 250 year old vampire, born in 1766, he discovers his true nature as an adult and slays the vampire hunters who attempt to stake him. An ardent royalist he rescues the head of Marie Antoinette (after locking her blood from the guillotine blade) and keeps it pickled in a jar. Faking his own death he fights against revolutions throughout the centuries changing his identity and making himself younger time after time. Eventually he ends up in Chile as the young Lieutenant Pinochet, his career proceeds and he overthrows Allende instituting a bloody dictatorship but eventually he falls and is reviled. He fakes his death once more and retires to a country retreat with his wife and faithful butler. He finally wants to die a for real but has forgotten where his ill-gotten gains have been hidden. His five children descend on the estate intent on getting their inheritance. An accountant has been hired to track down the missing loot but she is secretly an Exorcist Nun, But even here there are twists and turns as this is a house built on deceit. Madame Pinochet is truly Lady Macbeth, jealous that she was never given the rewards bestowed by Pinochet on his old army comrade/butler.Very much a dark/satire comedy, when the Exorcist/Accountant questions Pinochet, his wife and children about their dodgy business dealings the dialogue is based in actual court findings. The horror elements and vampire lore are quire effective. Filmed in monochrome the utter darkness of Pinochet's life (and that of his brood) is well portrayed. Donning his his General's uniform and cape he flies to cities to dine on victims. This vampire prefers to rip out hearts to get the best sustenance. As a modern touch, liquidisers are now used to get the most out of these vital organs. We learn how this vampire sucked the lifeblood from a nation but he portrays himself as a victim who was bribed by crooked businessmen.. There are laughs but there is a danger that they will choke in your throat. Perhaps the real humour is in the identity of the narrator, herself a vampire who flies south in an attempt to save Pinochet from himself. A tad didactic at times which might put some people off nevertheless this is an engrossing tale of evil. Directed by Pablo Larraín, written by Larraín and Guillermo Calderón.

"El Conde (2023)","Darkly satirical bio-pic done as a horror film","gortx","EL CONDE (2023) - Director Pablo Larrain (SPENCER, NO) grew up in Augusto Pinochet's Chile and has used that backdrop to inform his work, but never so directly as in EL CONDE - although, with a major twist. In EL CONDE (The Count), Larrain makes Pinochet a literal monster: A vampire who, even after death, is still sucking the soul out of the Chilean people.Larrain, working with frequent screenplay collaborator Guillermo Calderon, has fashioned a true horror film. Gory and full of grotesque scenes, but, at it's core, it's a pitch black satire. It's not the first time that Larrain has taken such a fanciful tack with a 'bio-pic', his fabulous 2016 NERUDA turned the life of the namesake poet into a Film Noir thriller. EL CONDE is narrated in English and compactly traces Pinochet from his youth 250 years prior in France to his reign in Chile from 1973 to 1990 (Pinochet actually did have family roots tracing back to France). The bulk of the story takes place in the years after his official death (2006). Pinochet (Jaime Vadell) is living in a decaying old mansion with his long-time right hand man and butler, Fyodor (Alfredo Castro) and his less than loving wife Lucia (Gloria Munchmeyer). Pinochet's brood of ingrate children have gathered to divy up the family fortune which, in true dictator style, was largely stolen. An accountant, Carmencita (Paula Luchsinger), has been summoned to oversee the financial skulduggery. Carmencita is a nun and she functions as the 'Van Helsing' of the piece. She's also doubles as an Exorcist of sorts.The movie is shot exquisitely in Black & White by the great Ed Lachman (CAROL, VIRGIN SUICIDES). Lachman's work truly ascends when the Count takes flight sweeping over the landscape like a dark overlord. A later, first flight of a vampire, is one of the most soaring sights in a film this year. The sound work here is exceptional with a surround sound symphony of creaking floors and rotting detritus. The classically based music score adds to the gloom and doom. Visually, Larrain and Lachman make references to films such as Carl Dreyer's JEANNE D'ARC (Actress Luchsinger bears a striking resemblance to Falconetti) and VAMPYR. This count isn't content to just drink the blood of his victims - he consumes their very hearts as well.The theme of vampirism is an obvious metaphor, but Larrain handles it well, with delicious dark touches. Still, he can't help but let things get a bit too fanciful and drags in everything from Marie Antoinette to the Falklands war to a surprise cameo. It muddies things up a bit and extends the allegory a bit too thin, even as it strikes a strong blow about the permanence of evil.EL CONDE is a stirring movie, that doesn't fully hit its marks, but it does so with masterly style and intellectual vigor.","15 September 2023","8/10",NA

"El Conde (2023)","El Conde","henry8-3","Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, wants to die. Problem is, he's a vampire, which makes things quite difficult. Having lived for over 200 years, experienced the French Revolution as a young French army officer, several other historic events, settled down in Chile, worked his way to the top, ruled ruthlessly and opulently and now been hounded by people seeking the truth, he's feeling a bit jaded. His family, on the other hand, are looking forward to their inheritance.I watched this because the main premise of this movie - Augusto Pinochet is a 200+ year old vampire - intrigued me. However, that novelty wears off pretty quickly. There's still some good dark comedy throughout the film centred around this but not enough to sustain the intrigue that this initially created.More than being about Pinochet being a vampire, it's the fact that he's over it all and wants to die that is the spine of the plot. This works well, initially, but quickly gets bogged down as it seems to go around in circles, making no progress.That pretty much sums up the movie: much promise, with initial premises, plots and sub-plots that offer heaps of potential but go nowhere, slowly. It all feels so tedious and pointless.Even a very left-field twist towards the end can't lift this above mediocre. Very disappointing.","6 October 2023","5/10",NA

It's really quite bizzare, surreal, expressionistic, kind of incomprehensible and black as black comedy can be.

"El Conde (2023)","Great merits, but the film had the potential to be much better","guisreis","It is a strange film which is hard to fit any label or classification. It has great merits, but still disappointed my expectations. It also travels through multiple genres not fitting well any of them, for better or worse: gore horror, dark humour comedy, political satire, and even political thriller. Visually, the movie is very nice and Pinochet's portrayal is astonishing (how similar with the military devil makeup turned Jaime Vadell!). I loved all the vampire origin stories in Ancien Régime. It was also quite good to have a timeline drawn through Haiti, Cuba, Russia (Pinoche always against the revolutionaires)... it would be great if it were more explored indeed. The bad character of all members of the family and of the torturer butler was well depicted. However, the film also has serious drawbacks. The script is unbalanced and should have been tighter. Pace is irregular, alternating awesome moments with quite sluggish parts. The behaviour of the characters seemed too inconsistent too, being hard to understand their motivations, and not because they were deceiving them. The interviews by the exorcist nun were slightlty unconvincing as sonething to actually happen, but they did allow the script to mock and denounce a lot the multiple crimes (from corruption to murder) of Pinochet's family and their impunity.","16 September 2023","7/10",NA
"El Conde (2023)","A Dark Satire","Pairic","El Conde: Pinochet as a 250 year old vampire, born in 1766, he discovers his true nature as an adult and slays the vampire hunters who attempt to stake him. An ardent royalist he rescues the head of Marie Antoinette (after locking her blood from the guillotine blade) and keeps it pickled in a jar. Faking his own death he fights against revolutions throughout the centuries changing his identity and making himself younger time after time. Eventually he ends up in Chile as the young Lieutenant Pinochet, his career proceeds and he overthrows Allende instituting a bloody dictatorship but eventually he falls and is reviled. He fakes his death once more and retires to a country retreat with his wife and faithful butler. He finally wants to die a for real but has forgotten where his ill-gotten gains have been hidden. His five children descend on the estate intent on getting their inheritance. An accountant has been hired to track down the missing loot but she is secretly an Exorcist Nun, But even here there are twists and turns as this is a house built on deceit. Madame Pinochet is truly Lady Macbeth, jealous that she was never given the rewards bestowed by Pinochet on his old army comrade/butler.Very much a dark/satire comedy, when the Exorcist/Accountant questions Pinochet, his wife and children about their dodgy business dealings the dialogue is based in actual court findings. The horror elements and vampire lore are quire effective. Filmed in monochrome the utter darkness of Pinochet's life (and that of his brood) is well portrayed. Donning his his General's uniform and cape he flies to cities to dine on victims. This vampire prefers to rip out hearts to get the best sustenance. As a modern touch, liquidisers are now used to get the most out of these vital organs. We learn how this vampire sucked the lifeblood from a nation but he portrays himself as a victim who was bribed by crooked businessmen.. There are laughs but there is a danger that they will choke in your throat. Perhaps the real humour is in the identity of the narrator, herself a vampire who flies south in an attempt to save Pinochet from himself. A tad didactic at times which might put some people off nevertheless this is an engrossing tale of evil. Directed by Pablo Larraín, written by Larraín and Guillermo Calderón. On Netflix. 8.5/10.","21 September 2023","9/10",NA
"El Conde (2023)","Darkly satirical bio-pic done as a horror film","gortx","EL CONDE (2023) - Director Pablo Larrain (SPENCER, NO) grew up in Augusto Pinochet's Chile and has used that backdrop to inform his work, but never so directly as in EL CONDE - although, with a major twist. In EL CONDE (The Count), Larrain makes Pinochet a literal monster: A vampire who, even after death, is still sucking the soul out of the Chilean people.Larrain, working with frequent screenplay collaborator Guillermo Calderon, has fashioned a true horror film. Gory and full of grotesque scenes, but, at it's core, it's a pitch black satire. It's not the first time that Larrain has taken such a fanciful tack with a 'bio-pic', his fabulous 2016 NERUDA turned the life of the namesake poet into a Film Noir thriller. EL CONDE is narrated in English and compactly traces Pinochet from his youth 250 years prior in France to his reign in Chile from 1973 to 1990 (Pinochet actually did have family roots tracing back to France). The bulk of the story takes place in the years after his official death (2006). Pinochet (Jaime Vadell) is living in a decaying old mansion with his long-time right hand man and butler, Fyodor (Alfredo Castro) and his less than loving wife Lucia (Gloria Munchmeyer). Pinochet's brood of ingrate children have gathered to divy up the family fortune which, in true dictator style, was largely stolen. An accountant, Carmencita (Paula Luchsinger), has been summoned to oversee the financial skulduggery. Carmencita is a nun and she functions as the 'Van Helsing' of the piece. She's also doubles as an Exorcist of sorts.The movie is shot exquisitely in Black & White by the great Ed Lachman (CAROL, VIRGIN SUICIDES). Lachman's work truly ascends when the Count takes flight sweeping over the landscape like a dark overlord. A later, first flight of a vampire, is one of the most soaring sights in a film this year. The sound work here is exceptional with a surround sound symphony of creaking floors and rotting detritus. The classically based music score adds to the gloom and doom. Visually, Larrain and Lachman make references to films such as Carl Dreyer's JEANNE D'ARC (Actress Luchsinger bears a striking resemblance to Falconetti) and VAMPYR. This count isn't content to just drink the blood of his victims - he consumes their very hearts as well.The theme of vampirism is an obvious metaphor, but Larrain handles it well, with delicious dark touches. Still, he can't help but let things get a bit too fanciful and drags in everything from Marie Antoinette to the Falklands war to a surprise cameo. It muddies things up a bit and extends the allegory a bit too thin, even as it strikes a strong blow about the permanence of evil.EL CONDE is a stirring movie, that doesn't fully hit its marks, but it does so with masterly style and intellectual vigor.","15 September 2023","8/10",NA

"El Conde (2023)","Great merits, but the film had the potential to be much better","guisreis","It is a strange film which is hard to fit any label or classification. It has great merits, but still disappointed my expectations. It also travels through multiple genres not fitting well any of them, for better or worse: gore horror, dark humour comedy, political satire, and even political thriller. Visually, the movie is very nice and Pinochet's portrayal is astonishing (how similar with the military devil makeup turned Jaime Vadell!). I loved all the vampire origin stories in Ancien Régime. It was also quite good to have a timeline drawn through Haiti, Cuba, Russia (Pinoche always against the revolutionaires)... it would be great if it were more explored indeed. The bad character of all members of the family and of the torturer butler was well depicted. However, the film also has serious drawbacks. The script is unbalanced and should have been tighter. Pace is irregular, alternating awesome moments with quite sluggish parts. The behaviour of the characters seemed too inconsistent too, being hard to understand their motivations, and not because they were deceiving them. The interviews by the exorcist nun were slightlty unconvincing as sonething to actually happen, but they did allow the script to mock and denounce a lot the multiple crimes (from corruption to murder) of Pinochet's family and their impunity.","16 September 2023","7/10",NA
"El Conde (2023)","A Dark Satire","Pairic","El Conde: Pinochet as a 250 year old vampire, born in 1766, he discovers his true nature as an adult and slays the vampire hunters who attempt to stake him. An ardent royalist he rescues the head of Marie Antoinette (after locking her blood from the guillotine blade) and keeps it pickled in a jar. Faking his own death he fights against revolutions throughout the centuries changing his identity and making himself younger time after time. Eventually he ends up in Chile as the young Lieutenant Pinochet, his career proceeds and he overthrows Allende instituting a bloody dictatorship but eventually he falls and is reviled. He fakes his death once more and retires to a country retreat with his wife and faithful butler. He finally wants to die a for real but has forgotten where his ill-gotten gains have been hidden. His five children descend on the estate intent on getting their inheritance. An accountant has been hired to track down the missing loot but she is secretly an Exorcist Nun, But even here there are twists and turns as this is a house built on deceit. Madame Pinochet is truly Lady Macbeth, jealous that she was never given the rewards bestowed by Pinochet on his old army comrade/butler.Very much a dark/satire comedy, when the Exorcist/Accountant questions Pinochet, his wife and children about their dodgy business dealings the dialogue is based in actual court findings. The horror elements and vampire lore are quire effective. Filmed in monochrome the utter darkness of Pinochet's life (and that of his brood) is well portrayed. Donning his his General's uniform and cape he flies to cities to dine on victims. This vampire prefers to rip out hearts to get the best sustenance. As a modern touch, liquidisers are now used to get the most out of these vital organs. We learn how this vampire sucked the lifeblood from a nation but he portrays himself as a victim who was bribed by crooked businessmen.. There are laughs but there is a danger that they will choke in your throat. Perhaps the real humour is in the identity of the narrator, herself a vampire who flies south in an attempt to save Pinochet from himself. A tad didactic at times which might put some people off nevertheless this is an engrossing tale of evil. Directed by Pablo Larraín, written by Larraín and Guillermo Calderón.

"El Conde (2023)","Darkly satirical bio-pic done as a horror film","gortx","EL CONDE (2023) - Director Pablo Larrain (SPENCER, NO) grew up in Augusto Pinochet's Chile and has used that backdrop to inform his work, but never so directly as in EL CONDE - although, with a major twist. In EL CONDE (The Count), Larrain makes Pinochet a literal monster: A vampire who, even after death, is still sucking the soul out of the Chilean people.Larrain, working with frequent screenplay collaborator Guillermo Calderon, has fashioned a true horror film. Gory and full of grotesque scenes, but, at it's core, it's a pitch black satire. It's not the first time that Larrain has taken such a fanciful tack with a 'bio-pic', his fabulous 2016 NERUDA turned the life of the namesake poet into a Film Noir thriller. EL CONDE is narrated in English and compactly traces Pinochet from his youth 250 years prior in France to his reign in Chile from 1973 to 1990 (Pinochet actually did have family roots tracing back to France). The bulk of the story takes place in the years after his official death (2006). Pinochet (Jaime Vadell) is living in a decaying old mansion with his long-time right hand man and butler, Fyodor (Alfredo Castro) and his less than loving wife Lucia (Gloria Munchmeyer). Pinochet's brood of ingrate children have gathered to divy up the family fortune which, in true dictator style, was largely stolen. An accountant, Carmencita (Paula Luchsinger), has been summoned to oversee the financial skulduggery. Carmencita is a nun and she functions as the 'Van Helsing' of the piece. She's also doubles as an Exorcist of sorts.The movie is shot exquisitely in Black & White by the great Ed Lachman (CAROL, VIRGIN SUICIDES). Lachman's work truly ascends when the Count takes flight sweeping over the landscape like a dark overlord. A later, first flight of a vampire, is one of the most soaring sights in a film this year. The sound work here is exceptional with a surround sound symphony of creaking floors and rotting detritus. The classically based music score adds to the gloom and doom. Visually, Larrain and Lachman make references to films such as Carl Dreyer's JEANNE D'ARC (Actress Luchsinger bears a striking resemblance to Falconetti) and VAMPYR. This count isn't content to just drink the blood of his victims - he consumes their very hearts as well.The theme of vampirism is an obvious metaphor, but Larrain handles it well, with delicious dark touches. Still, he can't help but let things get a bit too fanciful and drags in everything from Marie Antoinette to the Falklands war to a surprise cameo. It muddies things up a bit and extends the allegory a bit too thin, even as it strikes a strong blow about the permanence of evil.EL CONDE is a stirring movie, that doesn't fully hit its marks, but it does so with masterly style and intellectual vigor.","15 September 2023","8/10",NA

"El Conde (2023)","El Conde","henry8-3","Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, wants to die. Problem is, he's a vampire, which makes things quite difficult. Having lived for over 200 years, experienced the French Revolution as a young French army officer, several other historic events, settled down in Chile, worked his way to the top, ruled ruthlessly and opulently and now been hounded by people seeking the truth, he's feeling a bit jaded. His family, on the other hand, are looking forward to their inheritance.I watched this because the main premise of this movie - Augusto Pinochet is a 200+ year old vampire - intrigued me. However, that novelty wears off pretty quickly. There's still some good dark comedy throughout the film centred around this but not enough to sustain the intrigue that this initially created.More than being about Pinochet being a vampire, it's the fact that he's over it all and wants to die that is the spine of the plot. This works well, initially, but quickly gets bogged down as it seems to go around in circles, making no progress.That pretty much sums up the movie: much promise, with initial premises, plots and sub-plots that offer heaps of potential but go nowhere, slowly. It all feels so tedious and pointless.Even a very left-field twist towards the end can't lift this above mediocre. Very disappointing.","6 October 2023","5/10",NA

But I'm an inglorious (and indestructible) Sisu from Finland!","Coventry","There aren't many directors that I monitor closely, waiting and hoping for their next film to come out as soon as possible, but Jalmari Helander is one guy I keep track off. His long-feature debut ""Rare Exports"" was one of the most uniquely original and pleasantly deranged horror tales of the new century, and even his somewhat commercialized breakthrough ""Big Game"" (starring Samuel L. Jackson as the US President crashing with Air Force One in the Finnish woods) was a lot better and more entertaining than you'd think as well.It took Helander nearly 8 years to return with a new film. At the Brussels' International Film Festival, where ""Sisu"" premiered and Helander was a guest of honor, he explained that he spent several years working on a personal dream project of his, but unfortunately it got cancelled entirely due to Covid. Out of pure frustration, or so he says, Helander wrote the script for ""Sisu"" in barely a couple of weeks. Well, if this near-brilliant explosion of action and sheer adrenalin is what he comes up with in a few weeks, then I sincerely hope he'll still get the chance to finish his other project.What a film! You know those movies where all the great highlights and action-packed moments already feature in the trailer? ""Sisu"" has a terrific trailer too, but there are still a few hundreds of other highlights left to discover in the film. In fact, this film is a one-and-a-half-hour trailer full of awesome moments. The comparisons I've read between ""Sisu"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Bastards"" are accurate. The extreme violence and narrative structure are identical, and both films feature lots and lots of Nazis getting killed. Everybody just loves watching Nazis getting butchered in the utmost brutal and sadistic ways, is it not?Aatami Korpi is a lone hermit digging for gold in the most northern region of Finland during the last months of WWII. When he hits the jackpot, he loads up his bag with pure gold and hopes to keep a low profile while heading back to civilization. When a platoon of Nazis finds out what he's carrying, though, they obviously want to steal it. But Korpi is not just a weak and defenseless recluse, or what did you expect? He's a force so determined and indestructible that only an obscure and local Finnish term for him exists.Evidently (and also similar to ""Inglourious Bastards""), ""Sisu"" requires quite some suspension of disbelief from the audience. This man has the fighting and survival skills of John Rambo, but in combination with the indestructability of a T-1000 Terminator! Whether shot at with heavy artillery or a rope, he cannot die. He remains under water for a ridiculously long time and walks away from plane crashes totally unharmed. Is it plausible? Nope. Is it entertaining? You bet! Especially when watching in a chock-full festival theater with a thousand of outrageous horror fanatics shouting at a screen. Must-see!","28 April 2023","9/10",NA

"Sisu (2022)","Over The Top Cult Hit","stevendbeard","Sisu is a complicated concept. In a way it is pure stoic perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, but it is important to note that it is not just determination. It is also cleverness, that manifests itself when you most need it. Sisu is finding the solution to a problem, no matter what. This movie is definitely about that. Aatami, our ""hero"", finds the way.Being old enough Finn to have known many people of this generation, this isn't even that much of an embellishment.The movie is quite simplistic. The Finnish characters don't even talk until very late into the movie (which is actually another insight into Finnish culture). You have a goldminer with gold and a company of Nazis hunting him. You can't really go wrong with this storywise. You just have to make the characters and the action interesting enough. Do they? Yes. This might me kind of mild in the age of superhero movies and the more traditional action movies copying the superhero movies, but it works. In some ways kind of refreshing to keep it all more grounded.While this might be more meaningful to me as a Finn, I would assume that if you enjoy mid-budget action, this will be right up your alley (although, at 6 million euros, the budget was much lower than what would be considered midlevel in bigger markets).","27 January 2023","8/10",NA
"Sisu (2022)","Yes, this is sisu","h79423","Sure, it was ridonculous and fun, but this could've easily been so much better had the filmmaker spent less time with the repetitive logic-defying suspension of disbelief with the outrageous confrontations and deadly fight scenes, and focused more on a singular theme and tone for the dramatics, with expanding on the narrative - instead of plugging in pointless chapters. You can take only so much nonsense before you start thinking if this is a war parody film. A little more dialogue and character building would've also gone a long way. Even at a mere 91 min runtime and the decent pacing, there was barely a story here to make a short film, let alone 91 mins. At least the cinematography, S/VFX and gore were top-notch though. Nevertheless, an entertaining popcorn actioneer.","21 May 2023","5/10",NA
"Sisu (2022)","A load of unbelievable rubbish!","therealjaysmoke","The opening scene with the geographic map along with the narration of the war was a good introduction into this movie. The cinematography was very nice. There were a selection of wide shots and picturesque landscapes as the main character navigated the land. I enjoyed the colors of this film that added to the grittiness of the action taking place.The film was broken down into chapters which I thought was fine but wasn't really necessary considering there were only a limited amount of characters all following the same plot line. There wasn't much of a story to this film. Basically a guy who wants no part of the Nazi war encounters some Nazi's that want to take his gold. He fights them in order to survive and keep his gold. While that story is simple it would have worked much better if there was more character development. Perhaps starting the film off showing how the main character lived before the war. A backstory into his life with some flashbacks maybe. There just wasn't any thought put into who this man was aside from the fact that he was dangerous and people knew of him.The look of all the characters was well done. The part of the Nazi leader was well acted and he had the look of a villain. He had the most dialogue in the film contrary to the main character who barely said a word until the end.The action in this movie was good but it was very much on the unrealistic side of things. The main character was basically indestructible to the point where it felt like he was Superman. Once again this could have worked better if he was given a backstory of somehow possessing superpowers. But since we were made to believe that he was just a human with special skills/ training it was a bit of an eye rolling experience.If you can go into this film expecting unbelievable action sequences then you'll be entertained enough for an hour and a half.","17 May 2023","7/10",NA
"Sisu (2022)","Don't get me wrong, I love my meat, but without the potatoes, it's not really a full meal.","Top_Dawg_Critic","Sisu is about a gold miner who finds the richest of golds in an underground pit. He must trade the gold for cash to a bank. Although, he lives thousands of miles away from a bank and must travel on foot. On the way there, he encounters German Nazis along the way who want to steal it from him. He must fight throughout all of them in order to deposit his gold.The first impressions of Sisu gave me that it was a bloody, fun, and good time of a gold miner killing Nazis. Since John Wick was heavily inspired by director, Jalmari Helander, that this movie is basically the German 1940's war version of John Wick. Jorma Tommila's (main protagonist) acting skills were badass from his creative surviving skills to kill the Nazis. The deaths were entertaining with the special effects and CGI of them. Overall, Sisu is good with its acting, kills, and story. I would recommend Sisu in theaters for a good action watch.","2 October 2022","7/10",NA
"Sisu (2022)","Determination in the face of overwhelming odds","Blue-Grotto","Who doesn't enjoy seeing evil Nazi's beaten to a pulp, torn limb from limb, and generally getting what they deserve? (Answer: other Nazis). Director Jalmari Helander dedicates Sisu to the art of killing goose-stepping fascists, pitting the despicable jack-booted German's against Aatami (Jorma Tommila), a hard-as-nails Finnish commando who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit'. After Aatami strikes gold in the wilds of Finland, he makes his way back to civilisation to cash in his hoard, but crosses paths with a Nazi platoon - and we all know that Nazis like to steal gold!!However, trying to take Aatami's treasure proves to be a big mistake: no matter what the German's do to him, he simply won't give up until he has gold back and every last Nazi is dead. The fact that the Finnish soldier is so indestructible takes some swallowing, until it becomes clear that his nickname - The Immortal - is to be taken at face value: this bloke has more lives than a cat. Once you wrap your head around the fact that Aatami simply does not die, the film becomes all the more fun, as the enemy come to realise that taking an immortal's hard-earned riches is an even dumber move than nicking a leprechaun's pot of gold.In terms of style, the film is very Tarantino-esque, split into 6 chapters, each introduced with a big bold title; the violence is graphic, with lots of blood and guts. There's even a group of female Finnish POWs who lend Aatami a hand in killing the baddies - and there's nowt more Tarantino than a gang of women unloading machine guns into a truck of Nazis. The ending takes the craziness up to eleven as the nastiest Nazi, Bruno (Aksel Hennie), makes his escape on a plane, unaware the Aatami has hitched a ride. The action ends with a bang for both Bruno and Aatami, but only one of them is immortal...One might argue that the plot is slight, and the film derivative in terms of execution, but if you're after a bit of mindlessly violent popcorn entertainment and found John Wick 4 needlessly overblown and overlong, this one should do the trick: it clocks in at a far more reasonable ninety-one minutes.","4 May 2023","4/10",NA

With just 6 million budget this looks much bigger.Some nitpicks: the nazis speak English, even when talking with each other, which is kind of weird.

But I'm an inglorious (and indestructible) Sisu from Finland!","Coventry","There aren't many directors that I monitor closely, waiting and hoping for their next film to come out as soon as possible, but Jalmari Helander is one guy I keep track off. His long-feature debut ""Rare Exports"" was one of the most uniquely original and pleasantly deranged horror tales of the new century, and even his somewhat commercialized breakthrough ""Big Game"" (starring Samuel L. Jackson as the US President crashing with Air Force One in the Finnish woods) was a lot better and more entertaining than you'd think as well.It took Helander nearly 8 years to return with a new film. At the Brussels' International Film Festival, where ""Sisu"" premiered and Helander was a guest of honor, he explained that he spent several years working on a personal dream project of his, but unfortunately it got cancelled entirely due to Covid. Out of pure frustration, or so he says, Helander wrote the script for ""Sisu"" in barely a couple of weeks. Well, if this near-brilliant explosion of action and sheer adrenalin is what he comes up with in a few weeks, then I sincerely hope he'll still get the chance to finish his other project.What a film! You know those movies where all the great highlights and action-packed moments already feature in the trailer? ""Sisu"" has a terrific trailer too, but there are still a few hundreds of other highlights left to discover in the film. In fact, this film is a one-and-a-half-hour trailer full of awesome moments. The comparisons I've read between ""Sisu"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Bastards"" are accurate. The extreme violence and narrative structure are identical, and both films feature lots and lots of Nazis getting killed. Everybody just loves watching Nazis getting butchered in the utmost brutal and sadistic ways, is it not?Aatami Korpi is a lone hermit digging for gold in the most northern region of Finland during the last months of WWII. When he hits the jackpot, he loads up his bag with pure gold and hopes to keep a low profile while heading back to civilization. When a platoon of Nazis finds out what he's carrying, though, they obviously want to steal it. But Korpi is not just a weak and defenseless recluse, or what did you expect? He's a force so determined and indestructible that only an obscure and local Finnish term for him exists.Evidently (and also similar to ""Inglourious Bastards""), ""Sisu"" requires quite some suspension of disbelief from the audience. This man has the fighting and survival skills of John Rambo, but in combination with the indestructability of a T-1000 Terminator! Whether shot at with heavy artillery or a rope, he cannot die. He remains under water for a ridiculously long time and walks away from plane crashes totally unharmed. Is it plausible? Nope. Is it entertaining? You bet!

"Sisu (2022)","Over The Top Cult Hit","stevendbeard","Sisu is a complicated concept. In a way it is pure stoic perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds, but it is important to note that it is not just determination. It is also cleverness, that manifests itself when you most need it. Sisu is finding the solution to a problem, no matter what. This movie is definitely about that. Aatami, our ""hero"", finds the way.Being old enough Finn to have known many people of this generation, this isn't even that much of an embellishment.The movie is quite simplistic. The Finnish characters don't even talk until very late into the movie (which is actually another insight into Finnish culture). You have a goldminer with gold and a company of Nazis hunting him. You can't really go wrong with this storywise. You just have to make the characters and the action interesting enough. Do they? Yes. This might me kind of mild in the age of superhero movies and the more traditional action movies copying the superhero movies, but it works. In some ways kind of refreshing to keep it all more grounded.While this might be more meaningful to me as a Finn, I would assume that if you enjoy mid-budget action, this will be right up your alley (although, at 6 million euros, the budget was much lower than what would be considered midlevel in bigger markets).","27 January 2023","8/10",NA

You can take only so much nonsense before you start thinking if this is a war parody film. A little more dialogue and character building would've also gone a long way. Even at a mere 91 min runtime and the decent pacing, there was barely a story here to make a short film, let alone 91 mins. At least the cinematography, S/VFX and gore were top-notch though.

"Sisu (2022)","A load of unbelievable rubbish!","therealjaysmoke","The opening scene with the geographic map along with the narration of the war was a good introduction into this movie. The cinematography was very nice. There were a selection of wide shots and picturesque landscapes as the main character navigated the land. I enjoyed the colors of this film that added to the grittiness of the action taking place.The film was broken down into chapters which I thought was fine but wasn't really necessary considering there were only a limited amount of characters all following the same plot line. There wasn't much of a story to this film. Basically a guy who wants no part of the Nazi war encounters some Nazi's that want to take his gold. He fights them in order to survive and keep his gold. While that story is simple it would have worked much better if there was more character development. Perhaps starting the film off showing how the main character lived before the war. A backstory into his life with some flashbacks maybe. There just wasn't any thought put into who this man was aside from the fact that he was dangerous and people knew of him.The look of all the characters was well done. The part of the Nazi leader was well acted and he had the look of a villain. He had the most dialogue in the film contrary to the main character who barely said a word until the end.The action in this movie was good but it was very much on the unrealistic side of things. The main character was basically indestructible to the point where it felt like he was Superman. Once again this could have worked better if he was given a backstory of somehow possessing superpowers. But since we were made to believe that he was just a human with special skills/ training it was a bit of an eye rolling experience.If you can go into this film expecting unbelievable action sequences then you'll be entertained enough for an hour and a half.","17 May 2023","7/10",NA
"Sisu (2022)","Don't get me wrong, I love my meat, but without the potatoes, it's not really a full meal.","Top_Dawg_Critic","Sisu is about a gold miner who finds the richest of golds in an underground pit. He must trade the gold for cash to a bank. Although, he lives thousands of miles away from a bank and must travel on foot. On the way there, he encounters German Nazis along the way who want to steal it from him. He must fight throughout all of them in order to deposit his gold.The first impressions of Sisu gave me that it was a bloody, fun, and good time of a gold miner killing Nazis. Since John Wick was heavily inspired by director, Jalmari Helander, that this movie is basically the German 1940's war version of John Wick. Jorma Tommila's (main protagonist) acting skills were badass from his creative surviving skills to kill the Nazis. The deaths were entertaining with the special effects and CGI of them. Overall, Sisu is good with its acting, kills, and story. I would recommend Sisu in theaters for a good action watch.","2 October 2022","7/10",NA
"Sisu (2022)","Determination in the face of overwhelming odds","Blue-Grotto","Who doesn't enjoy seeing evil Nazi's beaten to a pulp, torn limb from limb, and generally getting what they deserve? (Answer: other Nazis). Director Jalmari Helander dedicates Sisu to the art of killing goose-stepping fascists, pitting the despicable jack-booted German's against Aatami (Jorma Tommila), a hard-as-nails Finnish commando who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit'. After Aatami strikes gold in the wilds of Finland, he makes his way back to civilisation to cash in his hoard, but crosses paths with a Nazi platoon - and we all know that Nazis like to steal gold!!However, trying to take Aatami's treasure proves to be a big mistake: no matter what the German's do to him, he simply won't give up until he has gold back and every last Nazi is dead. The fact that the Finnish soldier is so indestructible takes some swallowing, until it becomes clear that his nickname - The Immortal - is to be taken at face value: this bloke has more lives than a cat. Once you wrap your head around the fact that Aatami simply does not die, the film becomes all the more fun, as the enemy come to realise that taking an immortal's hard-earned riches is an even dumber move than nicking a leprechaun's pot of gold.In terms of style, the film is very Tarantino-esque, split into 6 chapters, each introduced with a big bold title; the violence is graphic, with lots of blood and guts. There's even a group of female Finnish POWs who lend Aatami a hand in killing the baddies - and there's nowt more Tarantino than a gang of women unloading machine guns into a truck of Nazis. The ending takes the craziness up to eleven as the nastiest Nazi, Bruno (Aksel Hennie), makes his escape on a plane, unaware the Aatami has hitched a ride. The action ends with a bang for both Bruno and Aatami, but only one of them is immortal...One might argue that the plot is slight, and the film derivative in terms of execution, but if you're after a bit of mindlessly violent popcorn entertainment and found John Wick 4 needlessly overblown and overlong, this one should do the trick: it clocks in at a far more reasonable ninety-one minutes.","4 May 2023","4/10",NA

He has only one line in the whole movie (an instant classic), but he is acting very well just by using his face and body.""He is not immortal, he just refuses to die.""Congratulations for the writer/director Jalmari Helander, the movie looks really good, flows forward easily and is overall very cool and original, despite the overused tropes of evil nazis and action. With just 6 million budget this looks much bigger.Some nitpicks: the nazis speak English, even when talking with each other, which is kind of weird.

"Sisu (2022)","They want to steal mi gold! But I'm an inglorious (and indestructible) Sisu from Finland!","Coventry","There aren't many directors that I monitor closely, waiting and hoping for their next film to come out as soon as possible, but Jalmari Helander is one guy I keep track off. His long-feature debut ""Rare Exports"" was one of the most uniquely original and pleasantly deranged horror tales of the new century, and even his somewhat commercialized breakthrough ""Big Game"" (starring Samuel L. Jackson as the US President crashing with Air Force One in the Finnish woods) was a lot better and more entertaining than you'd think as well.It took Helander nearly 8 years to return with a new film. At the Brussels' International Film Festival, where ""Sisu"" premiered and Helander was a guest of honor, he explained that he spent several years working on a personal dream project of his, but unfortunately it got cancelled entirely due to Covid. Out of pure frustration, or so he says, Helander wrote the script for ""Sisu"" in barely a couple of weeks. Well, if this near-brilliant explosion of action and sheer adrenalin is what he comes up with in a few weeks, then I sincerely hope he'll still get the chance to finish his other project.What a film! You know those movies where all the great highlights and action-packed moments already feature in the trailer? ""Sisu"" has a terrific trailer too, but there are still a few hundreds of other highlights left to discover in the film. In fact, this film is a one-and-a-half-hour trailer full of awesome moments. The comparisons I've read between ""Sisu"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Bastards"" are accurate. The extreme violence and narrative structure are identical, and both films feature lots and lots of Nazis getting killed. Everybody just loves watching Nazis getting butchered in the utmost brutal and sadistic ways, is it not?Aatami Korpi is a lone hermit digging for gold in the most northern region of Finland during the last months of WWII. When he hits the jackpot, he loads up his bag with pure gold and hopes to keep a low profile while heading back to civilization. When a platoon of Nazis finds out what he's carrying, though, they obviously want to steal it. But Korpi is not just a weak and defenseless recluse, or what did you expect? He's a force so determined and indestructible that only an obscure and local Finnish term for him exists.Evidently (and also similar to ""Inglourious Bastards""), ""Sisu"" requires quite some suspension of disbelief from the audience. This man has the fighting and survival skills of John Rambo, but in combination with the indestructability of a T-1000 Terminator! Whether shot at with heavy artillery or a rope, he cannot die. He remains under water for a ridiculously long time and walks away from plane crashes totally unharmed. Is it plausible? Nope. Is it entertaining? You bet!

There wasn't much of a story to this film. Basically a guy who wants no part of the Nazi war encounters some Nazi's that want to take his gold. He fights them in order to survive and keep his gold. While that story is simple it would have worked much better if there was more character development. Perhaps starting the film off showing how the main character lived before the war. A backstory into his life with some flashbacks maybe. There just wasn't any thought put into who this man was aside from the fact that he was dangerous and people knew of him.The look of all the characters was well done. The part of the Nazi leader was well acted and he had the look of a villain. He had the most dialogue in the film contrary to the main character who barely said a word until the end.The action in this movie was good but it was very much on the unrealistic side of things. The main character was basically indestructible to the point where it felt like he was Superman. Once again this could have worked better if he was given a backstory of somehow possessing superpowers. But since we were made to believe that he was just a human with special skills/ training it was a bit of an eye rolling experience.If you can go into this film expecting unbelievable action sequences then you'll be entertained enough for an hour and a half.","17 May 2023","7/10",NA
"Sisu (2022)","Don't get me wrong, I love my meat, but without the potatoes, it's not really a full meal.","Top_Dawg_Critic","Sisu is about a gold miner who finds the richest of golds in an underground pit. He must trade the gold for cash to a bank. Although, he lives thousands of miles away from a bank and must travel on foot. On the way there, he encounters German Nazis along the way who want to steal it from him. He must fight throughout all of them in order to deposit his gold.The first impressions of Sisu gave me that it was a bloody, fun, and good time of a gold miner killing Nazis. Since John Wick was heavily inspired by director, Jalmari Helander, that this movie is basically the German 1940's war version of John Wick. Jorma Tommila's (main protagonist) acting skills were badass from his creative surviving skills to kill the Nazis. The deaths were entertaining with the special effects and CGI of them. Overall, Sisu is good with its acting, kills, and story. I would recommend Sisu in theaters for a good action watch.","2 October 2022","7/10",NA
"Sisu (2022)","Determination in the face of overwhelming odds","Blue-Grotto","Who doesn't enjoy seeing evil Nazi's beaten to a pulp, torn limb from limb, and generally getting what they deserve? (Answer: other Nazis). Director Jalmari Helander dedicates Sisu to the art of killing goose-stepping fascists, pitting the despicable jack-booted German's against Aatami (Jorma Tommila), a hard-as-nails Finnish commando who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit'. After Aatami strikes gold in the wilds of Finland, he makes his way back to civilisation to cash in his hoard, but crosses paths with a Nazi platoon - and we all know that Nazis like to steal gold!!However, trying to take Aatami's treasure proves to be a big mistake: no matter what the German's do to him, he simply won't give up until he has gold back and every last Nazi is dead. The fact that the Finnish soldier is so indestructible takes some swallowing, until it becomes clear that his nickname - The Immortal - is to be taken at face value: this bloke has more lives than a cat. Once you wrap your head around the fact that Aatami simply does not die, the film becomes all the more fun, as the enemy come to realise that taking an immortal's hard-earned riches is an even dumber move than nicking a leprechaun's pot of gold.In terms of style, the film is very Tarantino-esque, split into 6 chapters, each introduced with a big bold title; the violence is graphic, with lots of blood and guts. There's even a group of female Finnish POWs who lend Aatami a hand in killing the baddies - and there's nowt more Tarantino than a gang of women unloading machine guns into a truck of Nazis. The ending takes the craziness up to eleven as the nastiest Nazi, Bruno (Aksel Hennie), makes his escape on a plane, unaware the Aatami has hitched a ride. The action ends with a bang for both Bruno and Aatami, but only one of them is immortal...One might argue that the plot is slight, and the film derivative in terms of execution, but if you're after a bit of mindlessly violent popcorn entertainment and found John Wick 4 needlessly overblown and overlong, this one should do the trick: it clocks in at a far more reasonable ninety-one minutes.","4 May 2023","4/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","""I miss you... I miss you...""","mattiasflgrtll6","Finally. FINALLY. This is the movie which completely overwhelmed my expectations and blew me away.Romance is actually one of my favorite genres, but unfortunately it has let me down a lot more than once. Not the case with Carol. This has a strong possibility of being the best movie of 2015.Therese is a woman working in a store who has an interest in trains and photography. But her hobbies is not enough to escape her boring and quite uneventful life. Carol has a wonderful daughter and is doing fine financially... but has an husband (whom she is trying to divorce) who won't leave her alone and makes her feel miserable.These two people meet, and... they connect.First off, the story itself is already incredibly captivating. It takes place during a time period where homosexuality was not only frowned upon, but there were even laws against it. So seeing the two of them facing struggles in order to keep in contact with each other is fascinating to behold. And it is because the love story is so damn beautiful. There is a lot of visual language. Eye contact and body language often speaks for itself. And it's excellently executed, as you sometimes know exactly how these two character are feeling without a single word spoken. And even the dialogue itself has subtlety to it. There are plenty of times where either Carol or Therese insinuate feelings by using seemingly casual sentences. ""Your perfume... it smells good."" is really just a synonym for ""I want to kiss you"". ""Oh stop it, you look perfect!"" can very well mean ""I want to spend the rest of my life with you."" The lines are not obvious giveaways and I love it. The audience gets to think for themselves.But what really makes this movie work is the acting. It's absolutely amazing. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are at their best ever. They make the characters so real, so human, that you wish they actually existed. Kyle Chandler also throws in a remarkable performance as the husband. You root for the two girls... but you don't hate Harge either. There is one scene where he has gone so far as to get himself to the house Carol and Therese is staying at for the weekend. And when he's told he can't have her, I was really feeling bad for the guy!I can't remember the last time I have been as touched by a movie. It hit my heart just in the right places, and when I walked out of the theater I felt like I had just experienced someone else's life.Okay, the trailer revealed too goddamn much from the movie, so several important plot details I already knew beforehand. But even that couldn't stop the perfectly orchestrated ocean of emotions it bathed me in. Carol will stick to your brain like glue after you've watched it. Oh and the movie too ;)","5 August 2019","10/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","a gem","Kirpianuscus","After you read the novel, your expectations about its adaptation are not small. The lead actresses are a good promise . But is it enough ? No doubts, yes. Because, for me, it is more than inspired adaptation of a good book. It is a gem, from performances to elegance, atmosphere, flavors and tension, from grace to bitterness. Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett are the best options and you know that if you read, again, the book. It is a love story but it becomes, scene by scene, more. Maybe, a sort of confession. About a world, a meet, a clash and few people. And, not the last, in special manner, about yourself.","6 February 2016","8/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","Charming, subtle and in the end it all comes down to Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara's unforgettable, brilliant performances.","fabiolpinheiro1993","Carol is a good film, with a very important subject, and the script never addresses it head on, rather with class, elegance and subtly.It's a great love and life story about one woman fighting for her right to be happy and another trying to figure out how can she really be happy. Each of them is the answer to the other.The script could feature more insight, but then again, the film is supposed to be subtle and let the images speak for themselves. The cinematography is outstanding and the score is downright superb. There's a feeling, a certain atmosphere that makes the film truly peculiar and one of a kind.But in the end, i think that it all comes down to Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, as they give unforgettable, brilliant performances. They are always perfect of course, but here there's something one of a kind about their performances. Its not only the characters that fall in love with each other, but also you who fall in love with them. Its charming, important, powerful, resonant, and features two one of kind performances.","31 October 2015","8/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","Achingly tender romance about how love is a part of the human condition.","Sergeant_Tibbs","It's an inevitability that Carol will face categorisation as an LGBT film, but that's not the limits of how it should be considered. It's simply a heartfelt and deeply human love story where the principle couple confronts insurmountable odds. In Carol's case, these obstacles are the prejudices of the time and culture they live in. The film frames this discrimination in a tangible and legal way, as the titular Carol is accused of a morally indecent lifestyle by her ex-husband in order to win custody of their daughter. The film isn't interested in being a courtroom drama though, instead focusing on the blossoming relationship between Rooney Mara's Therese and Cate Blanchett's Carol. Todd Haynes is known for his heightened style that evokes the melodrama of Douglas Sirk, for instance. His 2002 film Far From Heaven feels plucked from the cinema of the 1950s. However, Carol is a film that feels plucked from the New York streets of the 1950s as the aesthetic here is surprisingly naturalistic. It doesn't quite breach a documentary-esque style with Edward Lachman's understated and pleasantly grainy cinematography, but it all comes organically and authentically with the elegant fashion of production and costume design and the atmosphere that its cold Christmas setting provides. It's a very restrained film – as there are only two particularly intimate scenes – but the film carries an air of sexual and romantic tension throughout. As Carol, Cate Blanchett challenges her polar opposite and equally excellent work with Haynes as a Bob Dylan incarnation in I'm Not There here. By nature of the film's structure, the first half is in the perspective of Therese and the second focuses on the perspective of Carol. There's an interesting inaccessibility about Blanchett in the first half that draws you into Therese's infatuation. Mara, one of the most promising actresses of this decade since her small memorable part in The Social Network, uses her own reserved detachness – something she's been frequently criticised for – to her own advantage. To watch someone like Therese open up after being so repressed is thoroughly cathartic. However, Blanchett whips the film from under her feet in the second half. She litters the first half of the film with nuanced hints and clues to her past desires, also communicating so much with very little. She's elusive, but Mara is a key source of intrigue at that point due to the honesty in her performance and unexpected dry wit. Once Carol is struggling to deal with her own internal conflicts, Blanchett is on fire and burns the house down with her ultimate rebuttal of the accusations against her. Kyle Chandler, her suffering husband soon to be ex-husband, shows such painful anguish in his brief outbursts. It's a measured performance that anchors the film and the stakes of the relationships. Every performance of the ensemble – from extras to bit parts – are delivering among their finest work. It's an all-rounder in terms of Oscar-contention, with Haynes perhaps being a more likely bet for Best Director than the film is for Best Picture. Blanchett has won too recently but if Weinstein works his magic, Mara would be a strong contender in either leading or supporting. Phyllis Nagy will certainly duel with Aaron Sorkin in Best Adapted Screenplay, even if her work is more patient, while the production and costume design ought to destroy competition. A sure bet should be Carter Burwell for his beautiful score that sunk my chest with its few powerful notes. It's an achingly tender film that will be timeless, even if it doesn't resonate with everyone with such specificity. Carol shouldn't just be a statement for our time and a condemnation for past mistakes, it's a demonstration that love is a part of the human condition regardless of sexuality. 8/10","1 November 2015","8/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","Subtle, beautiful","cowfeet","I loved this film for the subtleties. Lots of lingering, carefully framed shots and closeups. Lots of quiet scenes. Lots conveyed through looks and innuendo.Rooney and Cate captured what it's like to be nervous yet excited while falling in love. It felt real. It felt like two people unsure of themselves, offering up just a bit of their true feelings at a time and waiting for the other person to do the same before revealing more. Kyle Chandler's performance hasn't been commented on as much as the leads, but he was just as excellent. He played the part of tortured husband well without coming off as a mere villain. I sympathized with him and even understood where he was coming from.I thought the film captured the time period in a very unique way. Nothing was overtly flashy or Normal Rockwell 50s, and at times it even felt gritty compared to most depictions of the era, but it was really beautiful.The film stayed with me on the ride home, and I drove in silence while I reflected on it.

Set in the era of the McCarthy witchhunts and the post-war obsession with - one might as well call it panic about- gender roles, CAROL is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. Playwright Phyllis Nagy's screenplay pays Highsmith the compliment of maintaining the psychological conflicts and complexities. In particular, the character of Carol's conventional husband, Harge (played by Kyle Chandler) could have, in lesser hands, received much shorter shrift than here. Beautifully photographed, designed, edited, scored and acted, there's no reason to give it anything less than full marks.

"Carol(2015)","Engrossing","gsygsy","For me the greatest love stories don't have a difference, they have chemistry. Just having the couple in your movie be lesbian women doesn't necessarily make them interesting. That's what holds 'Carol' back for me. Not enough time and effort is actually put into making us believe and care for the lead character's relationship, we are just simply supposed to accept it. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara have been nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress and and Best Supporting Actress respectively. They never blew me away and I suspect it was more a case of getting the nod for going out of their comfort zones. They can say they felt they had great chemistry all they want, but what came across in the finished product speaks for itself. I suspect the Academy is smart enough to see this and consequently neither will get the win.There was a little bit of an uproar when the nominations were announced that 'Carol' hadn't been given a Best PIcture nod. To the people upset I would ask what exactly did it do to separate itself from every other film of 2015? Be about lesbians, would be about the only convincing answer I would accept. Is that enough to get you a nod? I would hope not. It's not really a bad film, it just comes across run of the mill and forgettable.

It takes its time to carefully construct the characters and to make us root for them. Credit is due to the cast, as Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are brilliant, and to the director Todd Haynes, who conducts well the story.Moreover, the film is visually stunning, with impeccable make-ups and wardrobes, not to mention the beautiful locations covered in snow while they take a road-trip.

"Carol(2015)","""I miss you... I miss you...""","mattiasflgrtll6","Finally. FINALLY. This is the movie which completely overwhelmed my expectations and blew me away.Romance is actually one of my favorite genres, but unfortunately it has let me down a lot more than once. Not the case with Carol. This has a strong possibility of being the best movie of 2015.Therese is a woman working in a store who has an interest in trains and photography. But her hobbies is not enough to escape her boring and quite uneventful life. Carol has a wonderful daughter and is doing fine financially... but has an husband (whom she is trying to divorce) who won't leave her alone and makes her feel miserable.These two people meet, and... they connect.First off, the story itself is already incredibly captivating. It takes place during a time period where homosexuality was not only frowned upon, but there were even laws against it. So seeing the two of them facing struggles in order to keep in contact with each other is fascinating to behold. And it is because the love story is so damn beautiful. There is a lot of visual language. Eye contact and body language often speaks for itself. And it's excellently executed, as you sometimes know exactly how these two character are feeling without a single word spoken. And even the dialogue itself has subtlety to it. There are plenty of times where either Carol or Therese insinuate feelings by using seemingly casual sentences. ""Your perfume... it smells good."" is really just a synonym for ""I want to kiss you"". ""Oh stop it, you look perfect!"" can very well mean ""I want to spend the rest of my life with you."" The lines are not obvious giveaways and I love it. The audience gets to think for themselves.But what really makes this movie work is the acting. It's absolutely amazing. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are at their best ever. They make the characters so real, so human, that you wish they actually existed. Kyle Chandler also throws in a remarkable performance as the husband. You root for the two girls... but you don't hate Harge either. There is one scene where he has gone so far as to get himself to the house Carol and Therese is staying at for the weekend. And when he's told he can't have her, I was really feeling bad for the guy!I can't remember the last time I have been as touched by a movie. It hit my heart just in the right places, and when I walked out of the theater I felt like I had just experienced someone else's life.Okay, the trailer revealed too goddamn much from the movie, so several important plot details I already knew beforehand. But even that couldn't stop the perfectly orchestrated ocean of emotions it bathed me in. Carol will stick to your brain like glue after you've watched it. Oh and the movie too ;)","5 August 2019","10/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","a gem","Kirpianuscus","After you read the novel, your expectations about its adaptation are not small. The lead actresses are a good promise . But is it enough ? No doubts, yes. Because, for me, it is more than inspired adaptation of a good book. It is a gem, from performances to elegance, atmosphere, flavors and tension, from grace to bitterness. Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett are the best options and you know that if you read, again, the book. It is a love story but it becomes, scene by scene, more. Maybe, a sort of confession. About a world, a meet, a clash and few people. And, not the last, in special manner, about yourself.","6 February 2016","8/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","Charming, subtle and in the end it all comes down to Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara's unforgettable, brilliant performances.","fabiolpinheiro1993","Carol is a good film, with a very important subject, and the script never addresses it head on, rather with class, elegance and subtly.It's a great love and life story about one woman fighting for her right to be happy and another trying to figure out how can she really be happy. Each of them is the answer to the other.The script could feature more insight, but then again, the film is supposed to be subtle and let the images speak for themselves. The cinematography is outstanding and the score is downright superb. There's a feeling, a certain atmosphere that makes the film truly peculiar and one of a kind.But in the end, i think that it all comes down to Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, as they give unforgettable, brilliant performances. They are always perfect of course, but here there's something one of a kind about their performances. Its not only the characters that fall in love with each other, but also you who fall in love with them. Its charming, important, powerful, resonant, and features two one of kind performances.","31 October 2015","8/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","Achingly tender romance about how love is a part of the human condition.","Sergeant_Tibbs","It's an inevitability that Carol will face categorisation as an LGBT film, but that's not the limits of how it should be considered. It's simply a heartfelt and deeply human love story where the principle couple confronts insurmountable odds. In Carol's case, these obstacles are the prejudices of the time and culture they live in. The film frames this discrimination in a tangible and legal way, as the titular Carol is accused of a morally indecent lifestyle by her ex-husband in order to win custody of their daughter. The film isn't interested in being a courtroom drama though, instead focusing on the blossoming relationship between Rooney Mara's Therese and Cate Blanchett's Carol. Todd Haynes is known for his heightened style that evokes the melodrama of Douglas Sirk, for instance. His 2002 film Far From Heaven feels plucked from the cinema of the 1950s. However, Carol is a film that feels plucked from the New York streets of the 1950s as the aesthetic here is surprisingly naturalistic. It doesn't quite breach a documentary-esque style with Edward Lachman's understated and pleasantly grainy cinematography, but it all comes organically and authentically with the elegant fashion of production and costume design and the atmosphere that its cold Christmas setting provides. It's a very restrained film – as there are only two particularly intimate scenes – but the film carries an air of sexual and romantic tension throughout. As Carol, Cate Blanchett challenges her polar opposite and equally excellent work with Haynes as a Bob Dylan incarnation in I'm Not There here. By nature of the film's structure, the first half is in the perspective of Therese and the second focuses on the perspective of Carol. There's an interesting inaccessibility about Blanchett in the first half that draws you into Therese's infatuation. Mara, one of the most promising actresses of this decade since her small memorable part in The Social Network, uses her own reserved detachness – something she's been frequently criticised for – to her own advantage. To watch someone like Therese open up after being so repressed is thoroughly cathartic. However, Blanchett whips the film from under her feet in the second half. She litters the first half of the film with nuanced hints and clues to her past desires, also communicating so much with very little. She's elusive, but Mara is a key source of intrigue at that point due to the honesty in her performance and unexpected dry wit. Once Carol is struggling to deal with her own internal conflicts, Blanchett is on fire and burns the house down with her ultimate rebuttal of the accusations against her. Kyle Chandler, her suffering husband soon to be ex-husband, shows such painful anguish in his brief outbursts. It's a measured performance that anchors the film and the stakes of the relationships. Every performance of the ensemble – from extras to bit parts – are delivering among their finest work. It's an all-rounder in terms of Oscar-contention, with Haynes perhaps being a more likely bet for Best Director than the film is for Best Picture. Blanchett has won too recently but if Weinstein works his magic, Mara would be a strong contender in either leading or supporting. Phyllis Nagy will certainly duel with Aaron Sorkin in Best Adapted Screenplay, even if her work is more patient, while the production and costume design ought to destroy competition. A sure bet should be Carter Burwell for his beautiful score that sunk my chest with its few powerful notes. It's an achingly tender film that will be timeless, even if it doesn't resonate with everyone with such specificity. Carol shouldn't just be a statement for our time and a condemnation for past mistakes, it's a demonstration that love is a part of the human condition regardless of sexuality. 8/10","1 November 2015","8/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","Subtle, beautiful","cowfeet","I loved this film for the subtleties. Lots of lingering, carefully framed shots and closeups. Lots of quiet scenes. Lots conveyed through looks and innuendo.Rooney and Cate captured what it's like to be nervous yet excited while falling in love. It felt real. It felt like two people unsure of themselves, offering up just a bit of their true feelings at a time and waiting for the other person to do the same before revealing more. Kyle Chandler's performance hasn't been commented on as much as the leads, but he was just as excellent. He played the part of tortured husband well without coming off as a mere villain. I sympathized with him and even understood where he was coming from.I thought the film captured the time period in a very unique way. Nothing was overtly flashy or Normal Rockwell 50s, and at times it even felt gritty compared to most depictions of the era, but it was really beautiful.The film stayed with me on the ride home, and I drove in silence while I reflected on it. That's how I judge a movie. If you are the type that loves character driven films, I'd very much recommend it. If you don't handle slow burn movies well, it might not be for you.","2 February 2017","7/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","I can't help you with that.","sharky_55","A perfect marriage of director and material, I can't think of anyone else but Todd Haynes for this story of love and desire blossoming in a desert of repression. Set in the era of the McCarthy witchhunts and the post-war obsession with - one might as well call it panic about- gender roles, CAROL is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. Playwright Phyllis Nagy's screenplay pays Highsmith the compliment of maintaining the psychological conflicts and complexities. In particular, the character of Carol's conventional husband, Harge (played by Kyle Chandler) could have, in lesser hands, received much shorter shrift than here. Beautifully photographed, designed, edited, scored and acted, there's no reason to give it anything less than full marks. I was completely engrossed by it from start to finish.","9 November 2015","10/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","Engrossing","gsygsy","For me the greatest love stories don't have a difference, they have chemistry. Just having the couple in your movie be lesbian women doesn't necessarily make them interesting. That's what holds 'Carol' back for me. Not enough time and effort is actually put into making us believe and care for the lead character's relationship, we are just simply supposed to accept it. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara have been nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress and and Best Supporting Actress respectively. They never blew me away and I suspect it was more a case of getting the nod for going out of their comfort zones. They can say they felt they had great chemistry all they want, but what came across in the finished product speaks for itself. I suspect the Academy is smart enough to see this and consequently neither will get the win.There was a little bit of an uproar when the nominations were announced that 'Carol' hadn't been given a Best PIcture nod. To the people upset I would ask what exactly did it do to separate itself from every other film of 2015? Be about lesbians, would be about the only convincing answer I would accept. Is that enough to get you a nod? I would hope not. It's not really a bad film, it just comes across run of the mill and forgettable. The best love stories leave you caring about the future of the relationship. For these two, I couldn't have cared less.","15 March 2016","10/10",NA

"Carol(2015)","An Affair to Forget","thesar-2","I watched Carol at the New York Film Festival, days after watching Freeheld. Since both movies talk about love relationship between two women, I was afraid I was going to see the same thing. Gladly, I couldn't be more wrong. Carol is such a beautiful movie, subtler than I had expected.Even though I loved the movie, I'm aware that it's not for everybody. It's not fast paced, as current films tend to be. It takes its time to carefully construct the characters and to make us root for them. Credit is due to the cast, as Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are brilliant, and to the director Todd Haynes, who conducts well the story.Moreover, the film is visually stunning, with impeccable make-ups and wardrobes, not to mention the beautiful locations covered in snow while they take a road-trip. Finally, the soundtrack is equally wonderful, with songs that correctly set the tone of their relationship.It probably won't be a box office hit, but I do hope everybody gets a chance to see it eventually.Full review: http://wp.me/p5Rk4c-f6","23 February 2016","5/10",NA

Its not only the characters that fall in love with each other, but also you who fall in love with them. Its charming, important, powerful, resonant, and features two one of kind performances.","31 October 2015","8/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","Achingly tender romance about how love is a part of the human condition.","Sergeant_Tibbs","It's an inevitability that Carol will face categorisation as an LGBT film, but that's not the limits of how it should be considered. It's simply a heartfelt and deeply human love story where the principle couple confronts insurmountable odds. In Carol's case, these obstacles are the prejudices of the time and culture they live in. The film frames this discrimination in a tangible and legal way, as the titular Carol is accused of a morally indecent lifestyle by her ex-husband in order to win custody of their daughter. The film isn't interested in being a courtroom drama though, instead focusing on the blossoming relationship between Rooney Mara's Therese and Cate Blanchett's Carol. Todd Haynes is known for his heightened style that evokes the melodrama of Douglas Sirk, for instance. His 2002 film Far From Heaven feels plucked from the cinema of the 1950s. However, Carol is a film that feels plucked from the New York streets of the 1950s as the aesthetic here is surprisingly naturalistic. It doesn't quite breach a documentary-esque style with Edward Lachman's understated and pleasantly grainy cinematography, but it all comes organically and authentically with the elegant fashion of production and costume design and the atmosphere that its cold Christmas setting provides. It's a very restrained film – as there are only two particularly intimate scenes – but the film carries an air of sexual and romantic tension throughout. As Carol, Cate Blanchett challenges her polar opposite and equally excellent work with Haynes as a Bob Dylan incarnation in I'm Not There here. By nature of the film's structure, the first half is in the perspective of Therese and the second focuses on the perspective of Carol. There's an interesting inaccessibility about Blanchett in the first half that draws you into Therese's infatuation. Mara, one of the most promising actresses of this decade since her small memorable part in The Social Network, uses her own reserved detachness – something she's been frequently criticised for – to her own advantage. To watch someone like Therese open up after being so repressed is thoroughly cathartic. However, Blanchett whips the film from under her feet in the second half. She litters the first half of the film with nuanced hints and clues to her past desires, also communicating so much with very little. She's elusive, but Mara is a key source of intrigue at that point due to the honesty in her performance and unexpected dry wit. Once Carol is struggling to deal with her own internal conflicts, Blanchett is on fire and burns the house down with her ultimate rebuttal of the accusations against her. Kyle Chandler, her suffering husband soon to be ex-husband, shows such painful anguish in his brief outbursts. It's a measured performance that anchors the film and the stakes of the relationships. Every performance of the ensemble – from extras to bit parts – are delivering among their finest work. It's an all-rounder in terms of Oscar-contention, with Haynes perhaps being a more likely bet for Best Director than the film is for Best Picture. Blanchett has won too recently but if Weinstein works his magic, Mara would be a strong contender in either leading or supporting. Phyllis Nagy will certainly duel with Aaron Sorkin in Best Adapted Screenplay, even if her work is more patient, while the production and costume design ought to destroy competition. A sure bet should be Carter Burwell for his beautiful score that sunk my chest with its few powerful notes. It's an achingly tender film that will be timeless, even if it doesn't resonate with everyone with such specificity. Carol shouldn't just be a statement for our time and a condemnation for past mistakes, it's a demonstration that love is a part of the human condition regardless of sexuality. 8/10","1 November 2015","8/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","Subtle, beautiful","cowfeet","I loved this film for the subtleties. Lots of lingering, carefully framed shots and closeups. Lots of quiet scenes. Lots conveyed through looks and innuendo.Rooney and Cate captured what it's like to be nervous yet excited while falling in love. It felt real. It felt like two people unsure of themselves, offering up just a bit of their true feelings at a time and waiting for the other person to do the same before revealing more. Kyle Chandler's performance hasn't been commented on as much as the leads, but he was just as excellent. He played the part of tortured husband well without coming off as a mere villain. I sympathized with him and even understood where he was coming from.I thought the film captured the time period in a very unique way. Nothing was overtly flashy or Normal Rockwell 50s, and at times it even felt gritty compared to most depictions of the era, but it was really beautiful.The film stayed with me on the ride home, and I drove in silence while I reflected on it. That's how I judge a movie. If you are the type that loves character driven films, I'd very much recommend it. If you don't handle slow burn movies well, it might not be for you.","2 February 2017","7/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","I can't help you with that.","sharky_55","A perfect marriage of director and material, I can't think of anyone else but Todd Haynes for this story of love and desire blossoming in a desert of repression. Set in the era of the McCarthy witchhunts and the post-war obsession with - one might as well call it panic about- gender roles, CAROL is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. Playwright Phyllis Nagy's screenplay pays Highsmith the compliment of maintaining the psychological conflicts and complexities. In particular, the character of Carol's conventional husband, Harge (played by Kyle Chandler) could have, in lesser hands, received much shorter shrift than here. Beautifully photographed, designed, edited, scored and acted, there's no reason to give it anything less than full marks. I was completely engrossed by it from start to finish.","9 November 2015","10/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","Engrossing","gsygsy","For me the greatest love stories don't have a difference, they have chemistry. Just having the couple in your movie be lesbian women doesn't necessarily make them interesting. That's what holds 'Carol' back for me. Not enough time and effort is actually put into making us believe and care for the lead character's relationship, we are just simply supposed to accept it. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara have been nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress and and Best Supporting Actress respectively. They never blew me away and I suspect it was more a case of getting the nod for going out of their comfort zones. They can say they felt they had great chemistry all they want, but what came across in the finished product speaks for itself. I suspect the Academy is smart enough to see this and consequently neither will get the win.There was a little bit of an uproar when the nominations were announced that 'Carol' hadn't been given a Best PIcture nod. To the people upset I would ask what exactly did it do to separate itself from every other film of 2015? Be about lesbians, would be about the only convincing answer I would accept. Is that enough to get you a nod? I would hope not. It's not really a bad film, it just comes across run of the mill and forgettable. The best love stories leave you caring about the future of the relationship. For these two, I couldn't have cared less.","15 March 2016","10/10",NA

"Carol(2015)","An Affair to Forget","thesar-2","I watched Carol at the New York Film Festival, days after watching Freeheld. Since both movies talk about love relationship between two women, I was afraid I was going to see the same thing. Gladly, I couldn't be more wrong. Carol is such a beautiful movie, subtler than I had expected.Even though I loved the movie, I'm aware that it's not for everybody. It's not fast paced, as current films tend to be. It takes its time to carefully construct the characters and to make us root for them. Credit is due to the cast, as Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are brilliant, and to the director Todd Haynes, who conducts well the story.Moreover, the film is visually stunning, with impeccable make-ups and wardrobes, not to mention the beautiful locations covered in snow while they take a road-trip. Finally, the soundtrack is equally wonderful, with songs that correctly set the tone of their relationship.It probably won't be a box office hit, but I do hope everybody gets a chance to see it eventually.Full review: http://wp.me/p5Rk4c-f6","23 February 2016","5/10",NA
"Carol(2015)","Didn't get me to buy in","jtindahouse","Others have already mentioned the film's beauty, elegance, attention to period detail, acting etc. All amazing. As a gay man ""of a certain age"" I felt deep gratitude for the gift given by the artists who created this film. The direction is so subtle and effective, using the all the tools of film making to communicate information, meaning, and emotion.Like Brokeback Mountain, this film turns cliché on its head and transcends the particulars of the protagonists' lives by illuminating more universal themes. It is a period/genre film that acts to balance well established tropes of its genre, a powerful corrective to SO MANY previous films that repeated the same old false, stereotypical, and often tragic images of gay lives. Beyond merely telling some real truth, Carol has so much to say about strength, resilience, and the possibility of finding joy in difficult circumstances. As such, it was deeply satisfying to this viewer.","15 January 2016","5/10",NA

Especially on paper, ""Brooklyn 45"" has an original concept, mixing supernatural elements with post-WWII drama.The idea is new and unconventional, for sure, and it also has a good cast and a few excellent gruesome effects, but the overload of dialogues versus the shortage of action footage inevitably puts the film to a mortal sleep. ""Brooklyn 45"" is almost entirely set in one single and interior location, namely a living room where a séance is performed and where the participants are subsequently trapped. You need a downright brilliant screenplay to make that work, and the film simply hasn't got that. ""Brooklyn 45"" starts out strong, but rapidly becomes repetitive and tedious, notably when the characters get stuck in their stubborn tunnel vision (""She's a Nazi"", ""She's not a Nazi"", ""Give me the keys"", ""No I won't give you the keys"", etc) and endlessly whine about the War not really being over.I kept hoping for a similarly abrupt transition as in ""We Are Still Here"", when the textbook ghost story/haunted house horror flick suddenly turned into a hardcore and gore-soaked slasher with an enormous body count. Alas, not this time...","3 November 2023","8/10",NA
"Brooklyn 45 (2023)","Ghosts from the present... that whine about the past!","Coventry","One room play created for film, and an ode to WWI through supernatural ethics. A group of people who were friends in WWII gather to support one whose wife has died. But these friends were on the higher echelon in the war, and they often took extreme measures in sake of the war regardless of the costs.As any good play does, characters have secrets, whether of action or character, that are uncovered and discovered through the fright and terror imposed by the supernatural element. A morality play so to speak and questioning the ethics of war and personal action.Acting is of good quality, and the plotting is simple as expected of this type of drama. The supernatural element adds to the tension and breaks some of the characters. Slightly trite and a bit characteristic, overall this was a worthy film to watch, just small in actual scope.","14 June 2023","5/10",NA
"Brooklyn 45 (2023)","One room play","jmbovan-47-160173","So, if you're thinking of watching this movie for jumpscares, or intense action, imma stop you right there. This movie is just a simple and linear thriller movie, as in a ghost story, set in the 1945 Brooklyn, NY. It's a reunion of 5 friends, who served in war in their own respective professions, where they sit down to grieve the aftermath of war, after the war is over and Hitler is dead. And to keep this review spoiler free, they meet up for a struggling friend out of them as well. The movie is set in a room where it starts, and ends and you won't have any moments where you are scared whatsoever (maybe 1 or 2 little bloody scenes for sensitive viewers). Even though it is just a linear, one directional blunt movie, it's definitely a good one time watch movie for when you're bored and have nothing to watch lol. Also, it'd leave you wondering with a few questions that are unanswered, even a very root questions of the plot, as a little open kind of ending. Take it as a mystery ""who dun it"" or ""did they do it"" thriller more than a horror movie, because labeling it under horror more, won't be right. But, I guess, isnt war horror in itself after all ?","10 June 2023","6/10",NA
"Brooklyn 45 (2023)","""The war's over""... says who ?","aashirjaved-99594","It's a B-Movie, but to be honest for a Shudder Original B-Movie it's actually pretty good. It gets off to a slow start, but when things warm up. They get pretty heated, and a lot of secrets come out. I had fun watching it.The acting is good, the special effects are decent. Although for the most part it takes place in one room, and it is very character driven. Them finding out things they didn't know about each other is what pushes the plot forward. It's a little different to what you'd normally expect from a film that uses a Oujda board as a plot device.Although some of the secrets come from their dead friends. So I'd say it both drama and horror.","11 June 2023","7/10",NA
"Brooklyn 45 (2023)","Drama and Horror Character Driven Plot.","icocleric","Brooklyn 45 evokes contradictory feelings. Well, it's impossible to take this movie seriously. The movie is a download, then they try to give you a chamber thriller, then they go to a teenage pseudo-horror with mysticism. Everything looks so bad and is filmed that it's even good. And when the level of absurdity reaches the highest degree, mysticism appears. But it looks so bad that it only causes cringe. Brooklyn 45 is a rare example when you wanted to shoot everything at once, but there is no money, and the cast is not surprising. Of course, this is a passing film, but it's not as bad as critics talk about it. This film is worth watching for those who are tired of films shot strictly within their genre, from Brooklyn 45 you do not know what to expect in 5-10 minutes of timing.","25 June 2023","6/10",NA

The problem is that it singlehandedly ruined the sequel trilogy by closing the second chapter with a dead end. There are truly baffling character decisions, awkward humor, useless subplots - it's by far the most frustrating Star Wars movie because of the potential it had. If it were 20 minutes shorter, it could have been something special, but the last act sees our characters in the exact same spot as they began. As a standalone movie, it's watchable.

"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017)","Almost Garbage","destinylives52","I'm not exactly sure what everyone else watched, but this is certainly no masterpiece. I've seen words like risk-taking, bold and edgy being thrown around. Bold? Gimme a break. There's more boldness in the Times New Roman font. This instalment has evidently, looking at aggregated scores, polarised viewers. And I can see why. In this episode, the rebels attempt to flee from The First Order and it's up to Finn to retrieve someone to help them infiltrate their primary ship. Meanwhile, Rey tries to convince Luke to help the rebels and train her in the Jedi religion. That's pretty much as grand as this chapter gets. Where is the grandeur!? Where are the stakes!? Why am I not on the edge of my seat! No matter how aesthetically pleasing the visuals are, the constant feeding of nostalgia and the inclusions of a few memorable scenes...it doesn't make a film great. This episode is weighed down by underdeveloped characters, sluggish pacing and pivotal elements that are rushed. I have no doubt in my mind that Rian Johnson's directing style was glorious, in fact the technical aspects to The Last Jedi are outstanding. Visually I cannot fault the effects that are used and also appreciated the use of puppets and animatronics, particularly the Porgs which are bound to make Disney a fortune. Various memorable scenes, such as a cruiser lightspeeding into another ship, make for some general entertainment. But, I can't shake off the fact that I was bored. It took nearly half the film's runtime to get going and become interesting. Kylo Ren is the most intriguing character with plenty of internal conflict. Adam Driver gives a perfectly good performance, full of emotion beneath his eyes. I can see it! They just didn't explore his character arc or utilise him to his maximum potential. The Force Awakens introduces us to these fascinating bubbly characters that are just utterly wasted in this. I'm uncertain about ""bold"" choices regarding Leia, Snoke and Luke...but even so, I wasn't enthralled enough to care.","25 February 2018","6/10",NA

Yeah, I'm old. But, I'm a little shocked at so many haters of this movie, many of you have given a 2! A 2???? Seriously?I've given The Last Jedi an 8. It's an epic and original Star Wars movie, with gorgeous cinematography and incredible music from the wonderful John Williams again. Rain Johnson has managed to expand the force mythology, inject some good ol' humour back into the saga, and throw in some wonderful surprises, that I believe, we all needed. It seems like many of you do not like change, or are not prepared to enjoy a Star Wars movie that takes risks. This movie takes huge risks; it dares to offer something fresh in a franchise that is over 40 years old. It also pays homage to the original trilogy in a beautiful and tasteful way. So, no, I do NOT understand the haters out there. Nevertheless, it's not a perfect movie. There are some risks that Johnson takes, that will upset some fans, but some of those decisions have made me ponder the force in a new way. One of the main problems for me was the 'detour' from the main storyline with Finn and Rose. This storyline felt a bit sluggish, 'forced' and feels kind of shoehorned in there, and it also doesn't really serve the greater story-but then again, maybe it DOES. I will need to see it again to decide on this. There were also a handful of 'dumb' little moments, that I won't get into, and certainly at times I was reminded that Star Wars movies were originally made for children, and while we have our darker adult themes at work here (and even spiritual themes), there are also many magical moments for children. Maybe us 'grownups' need to stop taking it all so seriously and learn to be kids again? For the most part, this is a solid, original and gorgeous Star Wars movie that I believe, makes The Force Awakens seem a little bland and unoriginal.

"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017)","Disappointingly Average","Liam3011","After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return Of The Jedi, The Force Awakens, and The Mandalorian (series) it's now time for The Last Jedi. I read tons of reviews stating The Force Awakens was the worst one while for me it was the best one. The worst one to me was The Last Jedi, it's just much too long, it has an uninteresting story with a lot of unnecessary scenes, the CGI's were good but that's only normal for a Star Wars movie, certainly for a recent one. I just feel the writers didn't know what to do at one point, it was just a bad script this time. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. It's not often you see sequels getting better than the first one but with Star Wars the quality of the movies just improve every time, except for Rogue One and The Last Jedi, those I thought were of lesser quality. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and The Mandalorian, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the tenth movie of eleven plus The Mandalorian in barely five days for me, next one today will be The Rise Of Skywalker, the latest and last one in the hope it will be better than this one, looking forward to it.","16 December 2017","8/10",NA

The movie is void of any significant story or dialogues, it lacks purpose and vision. Its rather an obvious and obnoxious mix of studio wishes for toy sales and trying to please as wide an audience as possible. So many things wrong dont know where to even begin. First of all, Jar Jar, the ever annoying horrible Jar Jar from previous movies at least had a purpose as a (very poor) comic relief character. The fluffy penguins in Last Jedi on the other hand are 100% transparently there for no reason but toy sales. 
The action trumps everything in the movie. I have nothing against good action but come on. And the characters are so blatantly cliche and repeating themselves. Luke, a seemingly wise Jedi, perhaps fed up with everything but how does that make him a miserable, cold, heartless bast*ard. All of the characters are so black and white, its mind numbing.
A good movie is a good movie, be it a simple comedic Thor Ragnarok or a thought provoking Matrix. But the Last Jedi is nothing of that, its a heartless product almost made by a (quality) hollywood generator machine working based on a formula of most prevalent cliches today and popular ideas/values. Also of course the SJW crowd had to have their say making all heroes,general,admirals whatever women and male hero black. And then throw in an asian sidekick,they mustnt be forgoten,that would be rasist. 
Its pathetic. The race or sex of characters shouldnt be forced,it should serve the story. It does anything but that here. It wasnt story first here. It was the marketing guy, the censor, the SJW representative and toy company. Only THEN came director,story,character.

But the Last Jedi is nothing of that, its a heartless product almost made by a (quality) hollywood generator machine working based on a formula of most prevalent cliches today and popular ideas/values. Also of course the SJW crowd had to have their say making all heroes,general,admirals whatever women and male hero black. And then throw in an asian sidekick,they mustnt be forgoten,that would be rasist. 
Its pathetic. The race or sex of characters shouldnt be forced,it should serve the story. It does anything but that here. It wasnt story first here. It was the marketing guy, the censor, the SJW representative and toy company. Only THEN came director,story,character.
Expect no sight or smell of anything original, thought provoking, tabboo breaking or good moral quandries.

The problem is that it singlehandedly ruined the sequel trilogy by closing the second chapter with a dead end. There are truly baffling character decisions, awkward humor, useless subplots - it's by far the most frustrating Star Wars movie because of the potential it had. If it were 20 minutes shorter, it could have been something special, but the last act sees our characters in the exact same spot as they began. As a standalone movie, it's watchable.

"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017)","Almost Garbage","destinylives52","I'm not exactly sure what everyone else watched, but this is certainly no masterpiece. I've seen words like risk-taking, bold and edgy being thrown around. Bold? Gimme a break. There's more boldness in the Times New Roman font. This instalment has evidently, looking at aggregated scores, polarised viewers. And I can see why. In this episode, the rebels attempt to flee from The First Order and it's up to Finn to retrieve someone to help them infiltrate their primary ship. Meanwhile, Rey tries to convince Luke to help the rebels and train her in the Jedi religion. That's pretty much as grand as this chapter gets. Where is the grandeur!? Where are the stakes!? Why am I not on the edge of my seat! No matter how aesthetically pleasing the visuals are, the constant feeding of nostalgia and the inclusions of a few memorable scenes...it doesn't make a film great. This episode is weighed down by underdeveloped characters, sluggish pacing and pivotal elements that are rushed. I have no doubt in my mind that Rian Johnson's directing style was glorious, in fact the technical aspects to The Last Jedi are outstanding. Visually I cannot fault the effects that are used and also appreciated the use of puppets and animatronics, particularly the Porgs which are bound to make Disney a fortune. Various memorable scenes, such as a cruiser lightspeeding into another ship, make for some general entertainment. But, I can't shake off the fact that I was bored. It took nearly half the film's runtime to get going and become interesting. Kylo Ren is the most intriguing character with plenty of internal conflict. Adam Driver gives a perfectly good performance, full of emotion beneath his eyes. I can see it! They just didn't explore his character arc or utilise him to his maximum potential. The Force Awakens introduces us to these fascinating bubbly characters that are just utterly wasted in this.

"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017)","The Force has properly Awaken","Equalizer16","I've been a Star Wars fan since I was 7 years old, and I even remember seeing Empire and Jedi on the big screen as a kid. Yeah, I'm old. But, I'm a little shocked at so many haters of this movie, many of you have given a 2! A 2???? Seriously?I've given The Last Jedi an 8. It's an epic and original Star Wars movie, with gorgeous cinematography and incredible music from the wonderful John Williams again. Rain Johnson has managed to expand the force mythology, inject some good ol' humour back into the saga, and throw in some wonderful surprises, that I believe, we all needed. It seems like many of you do not like change, or are not prepared to enjoy a Star Wars movie that takes risks. This movie takes huge risks; it dares to offer something fresh in a franchise that is over 40 years old. It also pays homage to the original trilogy in a beautiful and tasteful way. So, no, I do NOT understand the haters out there. Nevertheless, it's not a perfect movie. There are some risks that Johnson takes, that will upset some fans, but some of those decisions have made me ponder the force in a new way. One of the main problems for me was the 'detour' from the main storyline with Finn and Rose. This storyline felt a bit sluggish, 'forced' and feels kind of shoehorned in there, and it also doesn't really serve the greater story-but then again, maybe it DOES. I will need to see it again to decide on this. There were also a handful of 'dumb' little moments, that I won't get into, and certainly at times I was reminded that Star Wars movies were originally made for children, and while we have our darker adult themes at work here (and even spiritual themes), there are also many magical moments for children. Maybe us 'grownups' need to stop taking it all so seriously and learn to be kids again? For the most part, this is a solid, original and gorgeous Star Wars movie that I believe, makes The Force Awakens seem a little bland and unoriginal. Go and see it, it's the best Star Wars movie since Empire.","8 June 2018","6/10",NA

Unfortunately, the story and a true understanding of the Star Wars universe is lacking.The actions of some of the characters are completely against what we have seen in other films (the treatment of Luke Skywalker is absurd).The new characters introduced are irritating and shallow (Laura Dern's Vice-Admiral Holdo might be my least favorite character in Star Wars history).Force sensitivity is a joke (Leia, Luke, Kylo and Rey).The entire ""master code breaker"" plotline is frustratingly pointless.When I look at the poster for this movie, I think about the epic fight sequences and the daring visuals.

"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017)","Disappointingly Average","Liam3011","After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return Of The Jedi, The Force Awakens, and The Mandalorian (series) it's now time for The Last Jedi. I read tons of reviews stating The Force Awakens was the worst one while for me it was the best one. The worst one to me was The Last Jedi, it's just much too long, it has an uninteresting story with a lot of unnecessary scenes, the CGI's were good but that's only normal for a Star Wars movie, certainly for a recent one. I just feel the writers didn't know what to do at one point, it was just a bad script this time. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. It's not often you see sequels getting better than the first one but with Star Wars the quality of the movies just improve every time, except for Rogue One and The Last Jedi, those I thought were of lesser quality. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and The Mandalorian, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the tenth movie of eleven plus The Mandalorian in barely five days for me, next one today will be The Rise Of Skywalker, the latest and last one in the hope it will be better than this one, looking forward to it.","16 December 2017","8/10",NA

First of all, Jar Jar, the ever annoying horrible Jar Jar from previous movies at least had a purpose as a (very poor) comic relief character. The fluffy penguins in Last Jedi on the other hand are 100% transparently there for no reason but toy sales. 
The action trumps everything in the movie. I have nothing against good action but come on. And the characters are so blatantly cliche and repeating themselves.

Yeah, I'm old. But, I'm a little shocked at so many haters of this movie, many of you have given a 2! A 2???? Seriously?I've given The Last Jedi an 8. It's an epic and original Star Wars movie, with gorgeous cinematography and incredible music from the wonderful John Williams again. Rain Johnson has managed to expand the force mythology, inject some good ol' humour back into the saga, and throw in some wonderful surprises, that I believe, we all needed. It seems like many of you do not like change, or are not prepared to enjoy a Star Wars movie that takes risks. This movie takes huge risks; it dares to offer something fresh in a franchise that is over 40 years old. It also pays homage to the original trilogy in a beautiful and tasteful way. So, no, I do NOT understand the haters out there. Nevertheless, it's not a perfect movie. There are some risks that Johnson takes, that will upset some fans, but some of those decisions have made me ponder the force in a new way. One of the main problems for me was the 'detour' from the main storyline with Finn and Rose. This storyline felt a bit sluggish, 'forced' and feels kind of shoehorned in there, and it also doesn't really serve the greater story-but then again, maybe it DOES. I will need to see it again to decide on this. There were also a handful of 'dumb' little moments, that I won't get into, and certainly at times I was reminded that Star Wars movies were originally made for children, and while we have our darker adult themes at work here (and even spiritual themes), there are also many magical moments for children. Maybe us 'grownups' need to stop taking it all so seriously and learn to be kids again? For the most part, this is a solid, original and gorgeous Star Wars movie that I believe, makes The Force Awakens seem a little bland and unoriginal. Go and see it, it's the best Star Wars movie since Empire.","8 June 2018","6/10",NA
"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017)","Star Worse","mihai_alexandru_chindris","This film's downfall was the screenplay. The writing was all over the place with major plot issues and convoluted scenes. Even the attempted humor was stale. This felt more like a Disney film than a true Star Wars installment. For the long length of this film, the writing should have been tighter. However, still amazing cinematography and VFX, and the directing was OK considering the screenplay was a mess. Not sure how anyone can rate this a 1 (seeing lots of those) without any credit to the visuals. It's a fair and honest 6/10 from me","15 December 2017","9/10",NA
"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017)","Amazed by the negativity","castansfield","It is as if Rian Johnson watched the Star Wars movies on mute before writing/directing this film. Visually, the movie is stunning. From the set pieces to the action sequences, ""The Last Jedi"" has some of the best visual moments in the franchise. Unfortunately, the story and a true understanding of the Star Wars universe is lacking.The actions of some of the characters are completely against what we have seen in other films (the treatment of Luke Skywalker is absurd).The new characters introduced are irritating and shallow (Laura Dern's Vice-Admiral Holdo might be my least favorite character in Star Wars history).Force sensitivity is a joke (Leia, Luke, Kylo and Rey).The entire ""master code breaker"" plotline is frustratingly pointless.When I look at the poster for this movie, I think about the epic fight sequences and the daring visuals. This is fortunate, because the rest of the film is frustratingly disjointed from the rest of the franchise.Best Character: Kylo Ren

"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017)","Disappointingly Average","Liam3011","After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones, Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return Of The Jedi, The Force Awakens, and The Mandalorian (series) it's now time for The Last Jedi. I read tons of reviews stating The Force Awakens was the worst one while for me it was the best one. The worst one to me was The Last Jedi, it's just much too long, it has an uninteresting story with a lot of unnecessary scenes, the CGI's were good but that's only normal for a Star Wars movie, certainly for a recent one. I just feel the writers didn't know what to do at one point, it was just a bad script this time. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing. The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. It's not often you see sequels getting better than the first one but with Star Wars the quality of the movies just improve every time, except for Rogue One and The Last Jedi, those I thought were of lesser quality. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and The Mandalorian, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the tenth movie of eleven plus The Mandalorian in barely five days for me, next one today will be The Rise Of Skywalker, the latest and last one in the hope it will be better than this one, looking forward to it.","16 December 2017","8/10",NA
"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017)","A beautiful, humorous and magical Star Wars movie!","jonabyron","After George Lucas's execrable prequels and the mediocre The Force Awakens, I've learnt to keep my expectations low for any new Star Wars films in order to avoid total disappointment. Having just seen The Last Jedi, it appears that I haven't been keeping them low enough.The reasons for my loathing are the same as those noted in the countless scathing reviews here on IMDb, so I won't go into drawn out detail - suffice to say that the film frequently beggars belief, is massively bloated, defies logic and is full of misplaced humour (the worst moments being the horrible 'steam iron' gag and BB-8's handy coin launcher).3 out of 10, solely for the impressive special effects. Writer/director Rian Johnson shouldn't be allowed within 12 parsecs of another Star Wars sequel.","16 March 2018","6/10",NA
"Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017)","The worst of the newest installments","Top_Dawg_Critic","There is very little good to say about it. The movie is void of any significant story or dialogues, it lacks purpose and vision. Its rather an obvious and obnoxious mix of studio wishes for toy sales and trying to please as wide an audience as possible. So many things wrong dont know where to even begin. First of all, Jar Jar, the ever annoying horrible Jar Jar from previous movies at least had a purpose as a (very poor) comic relief character. The fluffy penguins in Last Jedi on the other hand are 100% transparently there for no reason but toy sales. 
The action trumps everything in the movie. I have nothing against good action but come on. And the characters are so blatantly cliche and repeating themselves. Luke, a seemingly wise Jedi, perhaps fed up with everything but how does that make him a miserable, cold, heartless bast*ard. All of the characters are so black and white, its mind numbing.
A good movie is a good movie, be it a simple comedic Thor Ragnarok or a thought provoking Matrix. But the Last Jedi is nothing of that, its a heartless product almost made by a (quality) hollywood generator machine working based on a formula of most prevalent cliches today and popular ideas/values. Also of course the SJW crowd had to have their say making all heroes,general,admirals whatever women and male hero black. And then throw in an asian sidekick,they mustnt be forgoten,that would be rasist. 
Its pathetic. The race or sex of characters shouldnt be forced,it should serve the story. It does anything but that here. It wasnt story first here. It was the marketing guy, the censor, the SJW representative and toy company. Only THEN came director,story,character.
Expect no sight or smell of anything original, thought provoking, tabboo breaking or good moral quandries. 
Just a lot of empty happening for 2 hours.","24 September 2022","2/10",NA

She doesn't seem like clever teenage girl suddenly shaken and intrigued by an unexpected new variable in her life, at times she kinda looks bored. Her narrating was good though.

" Miller's Girl (2023)","A pretty good film when reflected a bit upon it","vmagrigjr","Miller's Girl presents a perspective of a romantic affair between a student (Jenna Ortega as Cairo Sweet) and its teacher (Martin Freeman as Jonathan Miller). It is a very ambitious and intriguing idea to explore, I really liked the plot and how it slowly unfolded, how the characters evolved and how eventually Cairo and Martin turned out to be complex characters that carried a lot of personal and professional baggage yet they connected and felt heard and understood thanks to their mutual interest in literature and writing. Now, obviously there's a lot more that's going on, more nuances, subtlety and delicacy and not to even mention the other ""situationship"" presented but it makes you wonder on another level... does love have limits? Is there such a thing as a forbidden love? Does even right or wrong exist when love is involved? Or, at the same time... is it really about love or is it something else?Both Freeman and Ortega deliver good performances and it serve their characters well, but it sometimes felt during the first acts like they lacked that chemistry, that connection that was supposed to urge their attraction, desire, tension; that ""I want it so bad that nothing else matters""; their interaction with other characters involved seemed more natural than when they were together.Jade Halley Bartlett creates this motion picture with a sort of aristocratic dark fantasy visual language and score in mind which plays an important part in the production itself especially in certain scenes implying the ideas of mystery, of desire, even of the forbidden and the unacceptable - yet, it felt a bit all over the place and unnecessary at times because it created a few clichés such as the mysterious girl that comes out of a misty forest thingy and it just pulls you out of the story.Throughout the film it seems to be an incomplete puzzle yet in such a good way because you get most of the pieces, but you also have to create the missing ones by yourself. The ending is arguably the most impactful and well made on this matter because even though an open ending is not reinventing the wheel, this time the final scene can actually be interpreted in such many ways, all of them viable and credible since, as earlier mentioned, the film was packed with many nuances and tones, hints and implies of what actually might have happened.The film is pretty good when reflected a bit upon it.","5 February 2024","7/10",NA

Despite of the talented cast(saving it in a way from a total crash after the first half) and ambitious, some would even say pretentious, beginnings, for me, it felt short in building a solid foundations, which could have been a mean of explanation for what happens in the end.But on the bright sight, it has a nice soundtrack(not sure it's always used well enough - which is also not so bright. Excuse me, had a bad day).Let's not be all critical. It has moments that have the capacity to intrigue you, but in overall I couldn't sense the integrity. Expected more of 80s erotic thrillers' vibe. Definitely not a thriller and on the erotic part, pretty sure I felt more interested in Winnie and Miller's wife than the Jenna Ortega's Cairo(which I guess wasn't the writer/director's initial intension.Some better examples from last year:
1.of peculiar teacher-student relationships - About Dry Grasses
2.of successful writer wife-unsuccessful writer husband - Anatomy of a FallPs- the smoke doesn't help to build mysteriousness.","17 February 2024","5/10",NA
" Miller's Girl (2023)","The Struggle","Tactrix","So this movie had all the features of a good movie, great actors, great story, fantastic writing. So why not a 10? Well, the issue is the end. See there's a buildup in this movie, it makes assumptions without confirming anything. And it does this quite a lot. However it feels wildly incomplete. Like they made a movie and then cut 20% of it out, and that 20% was the revelation of what was actually happening. And it would have been an amazing movie if they had left that 20% in, but they didn't.Now the general feel of it is amazing, because it's atmospheric without meaning to be. I think it was written to convey each emotion with a specific place as a scene, and it really works.8/10 great cast, plot and writing, it just comes up short with the ending.","20 February 2024","8/10",NA
"Thanksgiving (2023)","For a modern-day slasher, it doesn't get much more enjoyable than this","kevin_robbins","I attended an advance screening of Thanksgiving (2023) this evening. The plot revolves around the infamous town of Plymouth, Massachusetts, grappling with a tragic Black Friday massacre. As the locals gear up to celebrate Thanksgiving a year later, someone decides to deliver festive justice to those responsible.Directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever), the film stars Patrick Dempsey (Grey's Anatomy), Addison Rae (He's All That), Gina Gershon (Killer Joe), Nell Verlaque (The Marijuana Conspiracy), and Rick Hoffman (Ballers).The movie is truly remarkable. I found myself smiling from the opening scene to the closing credits. It captures a 90s slasher vibe with a plethora of characters who could be the killer, a high school class facing peril, and a relatable motive for the antagonist. The kill scenes are all top-notch, earning a solid 10/10, with a perfect blend of creativity, gore, blood splatter, and more gore. The Black Friday and parade sequences are standout moments, eliciting cheers from tonight's audience. Noteworthy are the elite decapitation scenes and a sequence reminiscent of Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. For a modern-day slasher, it doesn't get much more enjoyable than this. I'd give this an 8/10 and highly recommend it.","20 December 2023","8/10",NA
"Thanksgiving (2023)","Not sure what people are watching","FeastMode","I'm a little stunned by the positivity of the reviews I've seen. Thanksgiving has some good surrounded by mostly bad.

"Thanksgiving (2023)","We've seen this movie, literally. Twice. Still fun-ish.","hnhnyc","At this point one would think after all these movies, Eli Roth would learn how to make a good movie.Unfortunately, he didn't so he doesn't.While the premise is fine and plot could be salvaged with someone better at writing, the whole movie is quickly spiraling into your average stupid slasher movie.They probably tried to make a new Scream like movie, but failed.There is so many, many (not important) characters in this that waste screentime, so many unused chekhov guns that is not even funny.Even worse, there are many plot dead ends, which is somehow worse than having a good ol' plot hole. For example - part about store camera backups. It looks like an important part of the plot but no, it just resolves itself in the minutes after being mentioned. And it was resolved by one of the characters just watching those backups at some random point, concentrating on the dumbest part of it, printing some photos and going to police. What?Having so many unncessary characters is probably seen on paper like having so many options for viewer to think who is the killer - ""Oooh, no, who it is, ooohh"". But in reality it just wastes screen time and the only thing getting killed is any hope for plot coherence.Which brings me to the pacing of the movie. It's done so amateursh and incompetent that I go back to the first sentence - how did this dude didn't learn after all these years to make a coherent story flow? There is no sense of time in the movie, no sense of space, no sense of plot order. Things just happen.One of the worst things a movie can do is to make viewer constantly think ""That doesn't seem right/That's stupid/What?"" while watching a movie.The ending also looks super slapped on, contrived at best.It's not the worst movie ever, or from this year, but it ain't good.

"Thanksgiving (2023)","Bad","Smarmelade","Even for a slasher pic, Thanksgiving is crude, messy (in every sense of the word) and ridiculously over-the-top. Far from being an homage to Friday 13th, Scream etc it's a mockery of the genre, devoid of any merit. It lacks a shred of originality, and tries to make up for this by going for grossness in ridiculous ways. I have a strong stomach, but grossness simply for grossness' sake makes me shake my head.Other than gore, there's no plot. There's no style, no elan - there's not even a character worth rooting for. There's no talent, either. Everything - writing, acting, directing, camera-work - is just dialled-in, by-the-numbers stuff. Usually the wrong numbers.I might add that the poster is misleading - presumably deliberately. It gives the impression that this is going to be a period piece - which might've been interesting. It isn't.I suppose I've only myself to blame for watching it.

"Thanksgiving (2023)","The Year's Biggest Turkey","Lomax343","We actually got it. It took a long time but we finally got a 'Thanksgiving' movie based on the infamous 'Grindhouse' trailer from 2007. I always liked to imagine what this film would actually look like. In all of the ways I envisioned it though, I never foresaw it being as coherent and well put together as this film ultimately was. This movie was a blast.The first thing to note is that the film is absolutely brutal. They haven't toned things down from the original trailer at all. They have committed to the concept and the film is that much better off for it. Like most Eli Roth films it feels like nothing is off limits.I was pleasantly surprised to find the film was done in a whodunit style. The mystery, and not knowing what characters could and could not be trusted, added another layer to the film and worked really well.When we first meet the characters, and in particular the teenage characters, I was a little worried they were going to be extremely unlikable, as is usually the case in these types of films. As the film went on though most, if not all, of them grew on me. And by the end of the film I actually cared about their fate.'Thanksgiving' is going to go down as one of my most pleasant surprises of 2023 for me. It was everything I wanted and more. 9/10.","16 November 2023","2/10",NA
"Thanksgiving (2023)","I never envisioned this film being so good","jtindahouse","Thanksgiving starts with a fantastic opening scene. The Black Friday shopping mayhem scene is straight out of South Park, with crazed shoppers rampling people to death in gruesome ways over a free waffle maker. That scene is perfectly acted, with all performers giving a spot on impression of awful greedy trash people. That scene has something to say.The rest of the film starts off as your average ""I know what you did last summer"" style revenge slasher with an unknown killer in a pilgrom costume stalking and killing the people responsible for the opening scene Black Friday tragedy.Towards the third act, the movie further devolves into needless, evil spirited torture porn.A central problem is the main characters, who are a chore to endure. All except the main girl (who seemingly has just one facial expression) and the Russian girl are awful. Especially the males. For a while I wondered if the director / writer were on a dare or pulling a prank by having every single line have the F-word in it. But then a few lines without it showed up. A pity, that would have been more clever than what we got. We are left with intensely unlikeable protagonists, waiting for them to be picked off one by one.The film barely gives us any hints to who the killer is, what in particular he's motivated by, and in the end pulls a random character out of the hat. The only reason I knew it wasn't one of the teens was that Gina Gershon had a brief appearance and death scene in the opening, so I knew the killer had to be connected to her. Otherwise why cast a name actor in a no name role?When the reveal does happen, it's ridiculously stupid, and most of all, the needless cruelty and sadism of the killer goes way beyond revenge. In particular one scene involving the centerpiece of the revenge is sickening, case in point being it's something that happened during the October 7th Hamas attack. It's so messed up that it ruins the tone of what should be a fun, scary holiday slasher / horror film. Eli Roth really needs to get his demons under control. Pushing the boundaries is one thing, but missing the tone of your movie is another.Oddly enough, the gore effects are quite bad. For a movie that goes so deep into gore, I was surprised it didn't look better.Speaking of things that look bad: the Killer's mask. This is a big one, since a slasher film lives and dies by its killer. The killer here looks boring. Like a low budget V for Vendetta, he's neither scary nor iconic. They must have realized the former, because midway during the movie, he burns his mask for no reason other than he knows he's in a movie and wants to look scarier.The film moves at a brisk pace, and thankfully the obligatory scenes of characters nervously tiptoeing through corridors with the Killer lying in wait aren't 5 minutes long like in older 80s and 90s Slashers where the narrative ground to a total halt before every kill scene. They throw in a few chase scenes to mix things up as well.Here's something I'm thankful for: Thanksgiving didn't bore me. It annoyed me with it's nasty characters, it repulsed me with the it's mean spiritedness, bit it didn't bore me.Had they kept the tone and social commentary from the opening scene, they could have had a real classic here. As it stands, this is a missed opportunity let down by a weak script and a director who's pathological need to shock undermines his talent.","23 November 2023","9/10",NA

I can't tell you how many times I have seen all of the 80s slasher flicks. I will binge watch them over and over. But I will never watch this one again. It's just so bad. I can't even laugh at it.

"Thanksgiving (2023)","Super Fun","tkdlifemagazine","Thanksgiving is what happens when you take all the bad of recent Halloween movies and mix it with Scream.The only good this film has going for it is an interesting slasher killer and brutal kills (some of those kills make no sense and are not possible), but they did look good. Everything else is trash!Terrible writing, horrible pacing, trash story, boring generic characters, and rittled with cliche slasher horror tropes. This film made me laugh from it all.Nothing about this film is different. Granted, it's not all that possible to be unique in the slasher genre, but we've seen everything this film has done before, and we've seen it done better.The highest compliment I can give Eli Roth for this film is that he did create an interesting slasher villain. He looks great and has great command of the screen. But you need more than an interesting slasher villain to carry your film and this horrible story, and these boring characters definitely did not do it.I genuinely do not understand how this film is getting the high scores and positive reviews it's getting.

Still fun-ish.","hnhnyc","At this point one would think after all these movies, Eli Roth would learn how to make a good movie.Unfortunately, he didn't so he doesn't.While the premise is fine and plot could be salvaged with someone better at writing, the whole movie is quickly spiraling into your average stupid slasher movie.They probably tried to make a new Scream like movie, but failed.There is so many, many (not important) characters in this that waste screentime, so many unused chekhov guns that is not even funny.Even worse, there are many plot dead ends, which is somehow worse than having a good ol' plot hole. For example - part about store camera backups. It looks like an important part of the plot but no, it just resolves itself in the minutes after being mentioned. And it was resolved by one of the characters just watching those backups at some random point, concentrating on the dumbest part of it, printing some photos and going to police. What?Having so many unncessary characters is probably seen on paper like having so many options for viewer to think who is the killer - ""Oooh, no, who it is, ooohh"". But in reality it just wastes screen time and the only thing getting killed is any hope for plot coherence.Which brings me to the pacing of the movie. It's done so amateursh and incompetent that I go back to the first sentence - how did this dude didn't learn after all these years to make a coherent story flow? There is no sense of time in the movie, no sense of space, no sense of plot order. Things just happen.One of the worst things a movie can do is to make viewer constantly think ""That doesn't seem right/That's stupid/What?"" while watching a movie.The ending also looks super slapped on, contrived at best.It's not the worst movie ever, or from this year, but it ain't good. There is a solid horror movie in there somewhere but that movie is not written, directed and produced by Eli Roth.","21 December 2023","5/10",NA
"Thanksgiving (2023)","Bad","Smarmelade","Even for a slasher pic, Thanksgiving is crude, messy (in every sense of the word) and ridiculously over-the-top. Far from being an homage to Friday 13th, Scream etc it's a mockery of the genre, devoid of any merit. It lacks a shred of originality, and tries to make up for this by going for grossness in ridiculous ways. I have a strong stomach, but grossness simply for grossness' sake makes me shake my head.Other than gore, there's no plot. There's no style, no elan - there's not even a character worth rooting for. There's no talent, either. Everything - writing, acting, directing, camera-work - is just dialled-in, by-the-numbers stuff. Usually the wrong numbers.I might add that the poster is misleading - presumably deliberately. It gives the impression that this is going to be a period piece - which might've been interesting. It isn't.I suppose I've only myself to blame for watching it.

"Thanksgiving (2023)","The Year's Biggest Turkey","Lomax343","We actually got it. It took a long time but we finally got a 'Thanksgiving' movie based on the infamous 'Grindhouse' trailer from 2007. I always liked to imagine what this film would actually look like. In all of the ways I envisioned it though, I never foresaw it being as coherent and well put together as this film ultimately was. This movie was a blast.The first thing to note is that the film is absolutely brutal. They haven't toned things down from the original trailer at all. They have committed to the concept and the film is that much better off for it. Like most Eli Roth films it feels like nothing is off limits.I was pleasantly surprised to find the film was done in a whodunit style. The mystery, and not knowing what characters could and could not be trusted, added another layer to the film and worked really well.When we first meet the characters, and in particular the teenage characters, I was a little worried they were going to be extremely unlikable, as is usually the case in these types of films. As the film went on though most, if not all, of them grew on me. And by the end of the film I actually cared about their fate.'Thanksgiving' is going to go down as one of my most pleasant surprises of 2023 for me. It was everything I wanted and more. 9/10.","16 November 2023","2/10",NA
"Thanksgiving (2023)","I never envisioned this film being so good","jtindahouse","Thanksgiving starts with a fantastic opening scene. The Black Friday shopping mayhem scene is straight out of South Park, with crazed shoppers rampling people to death in gruesome ways over a free waffle maker. That scene is perfectly acted, with all performers giving a spot on impression of awful greedy trash people. That scene has something to say.The rest of the film starts off as your average ""I know what you did last summer"" style revenge slasher with an unknown killer in a pilgrom costume stalking and killing the people responsible for the opening scene Black Friday tragedy.Towards the third act, the movie further devolves into needless, evil spirited torture porn.A central problem is the main characters, who are a chore to endure. All except the main girl (who seemingly has just one facial expression) and the Russian girl are awful. Especially the males. For a while I wondered if the director / writer were on a dare or pulling a prank by having every single line have the F-word in it. But then a few lines without it showed up. A pity, that would have been more clever than what we got. We are left with intensely unlikeable protagonists, waiting for them to be picked off one by one.The film barely gives us any hints to who the killer is, what in particular he's motivated by, and in the end pulls a random character out of the hat. The only reason I knew it wasn't one of the teens was that Gina Gershon had a brief appearance and death scene in the opening, so I knew the killer had to be connected to her. Otherwise why cast a name actor in a no name role?When the reveal does happen, it's ridiculously stupid, and most of all, the needless cruelty and sadism of the killer goes way beyond revenge. In particular one scene involving the centerpiece of the revenge is sickening, case in point being it's something that happened during the October 7th Hamas attack. It's so messed up that it ruins the tone of what should be a fun, scary holiday slasher / horror film. Eli Roth really needs to get his demons under control. Pushing the boundaries is one thing, but missing the tone of your movie is another.Oddly enough, the gore effects are quite bad. For a movie that goes so deep into gore, I was surprised it didn't look better.Speaking of things that look bad: the Killer's mask. This is a big one, since a slasher film lives and dies by its killer. The killer here looks boring. Like a low budget V for Vendetta, he's neither scary nor iconic. They must have realized the former, because midway during the movie, he burns his mask for no reason other than he knows he's in a movie and wants to look scarier.The film moves at a brisk pace, and thankfully the obligatory scenes of characters nervously tiptoeing through corridors with the Killer lying in wait aren't 5 minutes long like in older 80s and 90s Slashers where the narrative ground to a total halt before every kill scene. They throw in a few chase scenes to mix things up as well.Here's something I'm thankful for: Thanksgiving didn't bore me. It annoyed me with it's nasty characters, it repulsed me with the it's mean spiritedness, bit it didn't bore me.Had they kept the tone and social commentary from the opening scene, they could have had a real classic here. As it stands, this is a missed opportunity let down by a weak script and a director who's pathological need to shock undermines his talent.","23 November 2023","9/10",NA
"Thanksgiving (2023)","There's something wrong about this one","kuner-59029","I'm so confused about how this has a decent rating. This movie was painfully boring and predictable. The acting was absolutely atrocious. The story was as bland as it comes. I love cheesy horror movies, but this doesn't even count as one. I can't tell you how many times I have seen all of the 80s slasher flicks. I will binge watch them over and over. But I will never watch this one again. It's just so bad. I can't even laugh at it. Honestly, I'm insulted that anyone would put something out that is so bad. And that people would review it so well. I only went to see this movie based off of the reviews. It seems like people have lost touch with what makes a good movie.","2 December 2023","5/10",NA
"Thanksgiving (2023)","I'm at a loss","Gith13","There were so many opportunities for this movie to go wrong. There is nothing better than a painfully stupid concept well executed to the point that it is actually good. Thanksgiving is the only Thanksgiving slasher movie I can think of. It is really enjoyable and, somewhat, grisly in parts. Eli Roth has a a unique and twisted mind. Roth does a great job in all of his movies tempering his grotesque imagery and thematic content with humor. This is no exception. The cast is good and strong- had it been a no name Director the film would not have attracted so many named stars. Patrick Dempsey is very good. I liked it.","19 November 2023","2/10",NA
"Thanksgiving (2023)","Super Fun","tkdlifemagazine","Thanksgiving is what happens when you take all the bad of recent Halloween movies and mix it with Scream.The only good this film has going for it is an interesting slasher killer and brutal kills (some of those kills make no sense and are not possible), but they did look good. Everything else is trash!Terrible writing, horrible pacing, trash story, boring generic characters, and rittled with cliche slasher horror tropes. This film made me laugh from it all.Nothing about this film is different. Granted, it's not all that possible to be unique in the slasher genre, but we've seen everything this film has done before, and we've seen it done better.The highest compliment I can give Eli Roth for this film is that he did create an interesting slasher villain. He looks great and has great command of the screen. But you need more than an interesting slasher villain to carry your film and this horrible story, and these boring characters definitely did not do it.I genuinely do not understand how this film is getting the high scores and positive reviews it's getting. But oh well, perhaps it's just not for me.IMDb: 3/10

"Thanksgiving (2023)","Mind numbingly STUPID","natashafitzsimons","I was quite surprised yet happy to see a thanksgiving horror film getting such high praise. I went in with no expectations and only saw the trailer possibly once. Let me start by saying that this film has quite graphic kills and inventive kills at that. This film starts solid with an extremely dramatic opening and then follows the basic slasher whodunnit outline. I didn't find any of the characters interesting nor do I remember a single person's name so it was kinda hard to stay invested when I don't have a connection to anyone.After the killer is revealed the movie then rushes to the end. Not sure if the director wanted to keep the run time short or if they just didn't know how to end the film but it literally sprints to the end. If you're looking for a cheesy horror movie and just watching for fun this is for you. I just need a little more substance.","19 November 2023","2/10",NA
"Thanksgiving (2023)","For a modern-day slasher, it doesn't get much more enjoyable than this","kevin_robbins","I attended an advance screening of Thanksgiving (2023) this evening. The plot revolves around the infamous town of Plymouth, Massachusetts, grappling with a tragic Black Friday massacre. As the locals gear up to celebrate Thanksgiving a year later, someone decides to deliver festive justice to those responsible.Directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever), the film stars Patrick Dempsey (Grey's Anatomy), Addison Rae (He's All That), Gina Gershon (Killer Joe), Nell Verlaque (The Marijuana Conspiracy), and Rick Hoffman (Ballers).The movie is truly remarkable. I found myself smiling from the opening scene to the closing credits. It captures a 90s slasher vibe with a plethora of characters who could be the killer, a high school class facing peril, and a relatable motive for the antagonist. The kill scenes are all top-notch, earning a solid 10/10, with a perfect blend of creativity, gore, blood splatter, and more gore. The Black Friday and parade sequences are standout moments, eliciting cheers from tonight's audience. Noteworthy are the elite decapitation scenes and a sequence reminiscent of Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight. For a modern-day slasher, it doesn't get much more enjoyable than this. I'd give this an 8/10 and highly recommend it.","20 December 2023","8/10",NA
"Thanksgiving (2023)","Not sure what people are watching","FeastMode","I'm a little stunned by the positivity of the reviews I've seen. Thanksgiving has some good surrounded by mostly bad. I'll start with the few positives. It's mostly well-made from a technical perspective. I loved the scenes of carnage and chaos. And all of the kills made my jaw drop. It doesn't hold back.Everything outside of the kill scenes is bad. I wish they leaned more into the dark fun slasher vibes. Instead they try to be serious, which magnifies how bad, bland and dumb the rest of the movie is. And while the mystery is intriguing and unpredictable, the reveal isn't even a tiny bit satisfying.This will probably be more enjoyable if you haven't seen many movies.

That scene is perfectly acted, with all performers giving a spot on impression of awful greedy trash people. That scene has something to say.The rest of the film starts off as your average ""I know what you did last summer"" style revenge slasher with an unknown killer in a pilgrom costume stalking and killing the people responsible for the opening scene Black Friday tragedy.Towards the third act, the movie further devolves into needless, evil spirited torture porn.A central problem is the main characters, who are a chore to endure. All except the main girl (who seemingly has just one facial expression) and the Russian girl are awful. Especially the males. For a while I wondered if the director / writer were on a dare or pulling a prank by having every single line have the F-word in it. But then a few lines without it showed up. A pity, that would have been more clever than what we got. We are left with intensely unlikeable protagonists, waiting for them to be picked off one by one.The film barely gives us any hints to who the killer is, what in particular he's motivated by, and in the end pulls a random character out of the hat. The only reason I knew it wasn't one of the teens was that Gina Gershon had a brief appearance and death scene in the opening, so I knew the killer had to be connected to her. Otherwise why cast a name actor in a no name role?When the reveal does happen, it's ridiculously stupid, and most of all, the needless cruelty and sadism of the killer goes way beyond revenge. In particular one scene involving the centerpiece of the revenge is sickening, case in point being it's something that happened during the October 7th Hamas attack. It's so messed up that it ruins the tone of what should be a fun, scary holiday slasher / horror film. Eli Roth really needs to get his demons under control. Pushing the boundaries is one thing, but missing the tone of your movie is another.Oddly enough, the gore effects are quite bad. For a movie that goes so deep into gore, I was surprised it didn't look better.Speaking of things that look bad: the Killer's mask. This is a big one, since a slasher film lives and dies by its killer. The killer here looks boring. Like a low budget V for Vendetta, he's neither scary nor iconic. They must have realized the former, because midway during the movie, he burns his mask for no reason other than he knows he's in a movie and wants to look scarier.The film moves at a brisk pace, and thankfully the obligatory scenes of characters nervously tiptoeing through corridors with the Killer lying in wait aren't 5 minutes long like in older 80s and 90s Slashers where the narrative ground to a total halt before every kill scene. They throw in a few chase scenes to mix things up as well.Here's something I'm thankful for: Thanksgiving didn't bore me. It annoyed me with it's nasty characters, it repulsed me with the it's mean spiritedness, bit it didn't bore me.Had they kept the tone and social commentary from the opening scene, they could have had a real classic here. As it stands, this is a missed opportunity let down by a weak script and a director who's pathological need to shock undermines his talent.","23 November 2023","9/10",NA
"Thanksgiving (2023)","There's something wrong about this one","kuner-59029","I'm so confused about how this has a decent rating. This movie was painfully boring and predictable. The acting was absolutely atrocious. The story was as bland as it comes. I love cheesy horror movies, but this doesn't even count as one. I can't tell you how many times I have seen all of the 80s slasher flicks. I will binge watch them over and over. But I will never watch this one again. It's just so bad. I can't even laugh at it. Honestly, I'm insulted that anyone would put something out that is so bad. And that people would review it so well. I only went to see this movie based off of the reviews. It seems like people have lost touch with what makes a good movie.","2 December 2023","5/10",NA
"Thanksgiving (2023)","I'm at a loss","Gith13","There were so many opportunities for this movie to go wrong. There is nothing better than a painfully stupid concept well executed to the point that it is actually good. Thanksgiving is the only Thanksgiving slasher movie I can think of. It is really enjoyable and, somewhat, grisly in parts. Eli Roth has a a unique and twisted mind. Roth does a great job in all of his movies tempering his grotesque imagery and thematic content with humor. This is no exception. The cast is good and strong- had it been a no name Director the film would not have attracted so many named stars. Patrick Dempsey is very good. I liked it.","19 November 2023","2/10",NA
"Thanksgiving (2023)","Super Fun","tkdlifemagazine","Thanksgiving is what happens when you take all the bad of recent Halloween movies and mix it with Scream.The only good this film has going for it is an interesting slasher killer and brutal kills (some of those kills make no sense and are not possible), but they did look good. Everything else is trash!Terrible writing, horrible pacing, trash story, boring generic characters, and rittled with cliche slasher horror tropes. This film made me laugh from it all.Nothing about this film is different. Granted, it's not all that possible to be unique in the slasher genre, but we've seen everything this film has done before, and we've seen it done better.The highest compliment I can give Eli Roth for this film is that he did create an interesting slasher villain. He looks great and has great command of the screen. But you need more than an interesting slasher villain to carry your film and this horrible story, and these boring characters definitely did not do it.I genuinely do not understand how this film is getting the high scores and positive reviews it's getting. But oh well, perhaps it's just not for me.IMDb: 3/10

"Thanksgiving (2023)","Mind numbingly STUPID","natashafitzsimons","I was quite surprised yet happy to see a thanksgiving horror film getting such high praise. I went in with no expectations and only saw the trailer possibly once. Let me start by saying that this film has quite graphic kills and inventive kills at that. This film starts solid with an extremely dramatic opening and then follows the basic slasher whodunnit outline. I didn't find any of the characters interesting nor do I remember a single person's name so it was kinda hard to stay invested when I don't have a connection to anyone.After the killer is revealed the movie then rushes to the end. Not sure if the director wanted to keep the run time short or if they just didn't know how to end the film but it literally sprints to the end. If you're looking for a cheesy horror movie and just watching for fun this is for you. I just need a little more substance.","19 November 2023","2/10",NA
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","Metaphysical Tearjerker","evanston_dad","Ok, I feel like I have to go back and watch this one again already after reading some interpretations of the ending. I feel like a dolt for missing the clues leading to the twist, and I feel like I would appreciate the movie much more on a second viewing.But even with that, this movie knocked the wind out of me. Or at least part of it did. There are really two stories playing out in this film. In one, a man is able through some unexplained bit of magical realism to return to his family home where his parents, who died when he was twelve, are alive. These scenes are painfully poignant, and Andrew Scott gives a masterclass of acting as a man who is also still in some ways a little boy. A couple of moments with his parents, played well by Jamie Bell and Claire Foy, had me and the rest of the theatre I was in openly weeping.The other story is the one that somehow went over my head, a romance Scott's character strikes up with a man living in his apartment building, played by Paul Mescal. I wasn't into this storyline as much, and would have been content if the entire film had just been about Scott seeking closure with his parents. But again, I also didn't catch on what was actually happening with the Paul Mescal storyline, so I wonder if I would like that part of the film more on a re-watch knowing what I know now.If there's any justice in the world, Andrew Scott will receive some awards attention for this.Grade: A.","14 January 2024","8/10",NA
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","A Near Perfect Film on So Many Fronts","brentsbulletinboard","In a movie awards season that has had more misses than hits, it's gratifying to see one that not only lives up to, but exceeds, its potential. Such is the case with writer-director Andrew Haigh's latest offering, a heartwarming and heartbreaking story of love, reflection and healing all rolled into one. To say too much about the film would invariably lead to a plethora of spoilers, but suffice it to say that it tells a genuinely moving and touching tale of a 30-something gay Londoner (Andrew Scott) and his budding relationship with a mysterious new beau (Paul Mescal), an involvement very much influenced by the protagonist's relationship with his own past, most notably his involvement with his parents (Jamie Bell, Claire Foy). This is one of those pictures that's just about perfect in virtually every regard thanks to its stringent adherence to authenticity in the writing and the portrayals of its positively stellar cast, especially the highly underrated performance by Foy, whose role has puzzlingly been flying under the radar thus far. It's also a production that will likely surprise viewers in myriad ways, defying expectations and telling a story that's anything but apparent from what's in its promotional trailer. Moreover, I'm impressed by the fact that this is an offering featuring gay characters in which their sexuality is not the principal focus of the narrative, something that truly distinguishes this feature from so many others in this genre. Add to these attributes a sensitively chosen soundtrack and some surprisingly innovative cinematography, and you've got one helluva fine movie. To be sure, this is one of those releases that, if it doesn't touch you profoundly, you'd better check to see if you have ice water coursing through your veins.

"All of Us Strangers (2023)","I will never forget this film","dakjets","How on earth will I manage to find the right words to describe the cinematic experience this film gave me? (English is not my mother tongue) I still have to try.I remember Liv Ullmann in a lecture talking about the film Persona. She said a movie doesn't have to explain everything to you. Give all answers. But instead give you something that you take with you and think about. Maybe after a while you think; aha, that's how it was! She also said that a film can change you, and give you new perspectives. I think that is a summary I can share with her about this special, beautiful and profound film.For me, who also lost my parents at an early age, the film's message about loss and coming to terms with loss was right at the center of my heart. I have very rarely experienced such magnificent acting as Paul Mescena and Andrew Scott give us here. But I don't think the message would have been as real without Andrew Haigh's script and the lead actors. That these two actors and the film are not included in the Oscar nominations this year is shocking. They give it their all in this film, and take us viewers on a journey about alienation, loneliness and, not least, how to live on after great losses.In addition to excellent acting, a strong message, Andrew Haigh has also provided excellent music, a journey back in time for me as a youth in the 80s.

"All of Us Strangers (2023)","""Don't let this get tangled up again.""","masonsaul","All of Us StrangersI am writing this review 6 hours after I watched it. I originally wanted to think on it more, but I decided that a raw response is necessary to such a raw film.Adam, a screenwriter in London, is attempting to write about his parents who died before his 12th birthday in a car crash. After he evacuates his apartment due to a false alarm, he catches the eye of Harry, another tenant of the building. After initially rebuffing Harry due to his heavy intoxication, Adam starts to open up about his parents to him.While this is going on, Adam begins traveling to his hometown where he discovers his parents, alive and well, but the same age as they were when they died. They immediately recognize him as their middle aged son, and spend the next several weeks learning about his life after their death while also discovering how he felt as a closeted gay kid in the 1980s.Who would not want a chance to speak to loved ones who were taken away too soon? Wouldn't one also play and replay conversations that could never be? Adam even tells his mother about how he did that in the years after their deaths, while ironically speaking to a dead woman.One of the main themes presented is loneliness. Adam was lonely as a kid who could not talk to his parents about either being gay, or about why he was being bullied. Adam was, and still is, lonely after his parents' death. He speaks of failed relationships in such vague terms that one wonders if he had any at all, especially after he admits to Harry that it's been a while since he's been intimate with a man. He continues opening up to Harry, allowing him to be taken out clubbing, dancing and sleeping over.Another main theme reveals itself in Adam's mental illness, specifically in his coping with depression. He listens to old music from his childhood, specifically The Power of Love by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, shown in the film more than once. He tells stories of himself to Harry, who listens attentively and holds him at night during bad dreams. All the while, he sneaks off to his childhood home, where he continues to speak to his dead parents.I admit that I had trouble writing the final paragraph of my review. The movie was already emotional throughout its entirety. What happens in the last few minutes completely changed everything. I can't write down what I'm feeling without spoiling the movie. However, I will write that the ending can only be described as stunning and beautiful.","16 January 2024","10/10",NA

"All of Us Strangers (2023)","Always on my mind is now one of favorite songs!","UniqueParticle","All of Us Strangers is one of the most tender love stories put to film in recent memory and a frightening number of people will choose not to see it because it is a gay one at that. Just thought I'd disclose this aspect upfront so that only the worthy stick around for this read. We good? Good.Directed by Andrew Haigh (45 Years) and based in part on the Taichi Yamada novel Strangers, this movie tells of a reclusive London-based screenwriter named Adam (Andrew Scott of Fleabag and Sherlock) who lives in an all-too-quiet apartment building where the only other living soul appears to be the oft-drunk Harry (Paul Mescal of Aftersun), who begins to act flirtily towards him. As you may have guessed, the two eventually bond and fall in love, even as Adam finds Harry a bit mysterious at first and, partly due to what he was taught re: sexuality as a youngster, isn't as comfortable with intimate touch -- initially.Sheila O'Malley put it best when she wrote that All of Us Strangers, almost immediately, has a ""surreal, almost supernatural atmosphere"". I don't know how much I ought to give away, but I can tell you it's not for naught. When I say that the apartment building seems strangely quiet, I mean it seems almost unearthly; it is no surprise that the posters make use of the almost entirely dark building where only two windows are lit up -- it is an image that sets the tone.All the same, love is discovered in this setting (this connection, taking place in an eerie realm where connections at first seem impossible, recalls 2015's Anomalisa in a lot of ways) and it isn't long before our hearts are grabbed and then broken. This oft-surreal film is nonetheless very much, devastatingly real.Adam is also troubled by thoughts about his parents (Jamie Bell; Claire Foy) as he keeps revisiting his (ostensibly) abandoned childhood home. He has a series of dreams (or are they dreams?) where he goes through the conversations he wishes he'd had -- the sort of conversations that frankly a lot of people, be they gay children of traditionally-minded parents or not, wish they'd had with their folks; the sort of conversations we typically don't get around to before it's too late, resorting to having them in our heads, sometimes in the form of revisiting moments and trying against all logic to rewrite them.These sequences exemplify some of the best and most emotionally honest acting of the past year. It is one of those films that make you realize how good other films aren't, particularly those of the romance variety that too often settle for tried routines and formulas while rarely doing anything stylistically intriguing or letting the actors be truly vulnerable. (I'm aware, painfully so, that that's what the crowds want; the statement I heard from a rom-com fan in high school, that ""film is about hot people and satisfying endings"", still echoes in my mind.)On a similar note: as many viewers of British/English cinema will point out, this one sticks out with its artful compositions (note especially its usage of mirrors and windows), dreamlike editing, deliberate color choices, and occasional magical realism. This isn't a first or anything, but it seems we often associate English film with gritty realism -- think This is England or Billy Elliot. I assure you, though, that the English are quite capable of outstanding visual communication. There are edits and framing/blocking choices in All of Us Strangers that cut even deeper than that one ""reveal"" in 45 Years. If you know, you know.Oh and of course, as a long-time fan of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, I can't forget to mention how the film uses their 1984 album Beyond the Pleasuredome, particularly their best song ""The Power of Love"", as a reoccurring motif; a devastating one. The music video is also referenced, in ways I cannot reveal here. Best you go see this wonderful picture before I say too much.And remember: let yourself be beautiful.","31 January 2024","9/10",NA
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","Dreams are like angels -- they keep bad at bay","TheVictoriousV","The film is a devastating look at one man's loneliness. Andrew Scott is giving a brilliant performance. With a simple facial expression, he can tell an entire story. He is one of the best actors around. (Scott, Mescal, Bale, Day Lewis -all great all non-American. Where are the great young American actors? But I digress..)
Claire Foy is wonderful and radiant. Jamie Bell has less to do but is very effective in his scenes with Scott. Paul Mescal is excellent- when you can understand him! His first scene when Harry comes knocking on Adam's door needs subtitles! The powerful ending is simultaneously chilling, frightening, and heartbreaking. There's a couple of ways to look at it. But I leave that for the viewer to determine. Do not miss!","29 October 2023","8/10",NA
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","One Powerful punch","joebnow","All of us Strangers tells the story of screenwriter Adam who has a chance encounter with Harry from his tower block during a fire alarm. What follows is an exploration of Adam's life, namely the impact of losing his parents at a young age and growing up with a secret that he withheld from his parents and those close to him. The story is told through Adam seemingly visiting his childhood home and speaking to his parents about the life he has lived as well as through present day conversations with Harry. The way this is portrayed may confuse some audience members.The film touches on loss, loneliness, acceptance and grief. It's well acted and I enjoyed that the film was shot in a local London area that I'm familiar with. Seeing familiar spots, train journeys and local shopping centres was a cool touch for such a well-received film. I appreciate the film's themes however I wasn't as engrossed or touched the film as most films goers were which is a shame. It is one of those films where if it pulls you in, it will take you on deep ride but if it doesn't, it can become a bit of a slog due to its testing pace. This was surprising as it's was the first sub two hour theatre experience of the year but it felt just as long as most of the Oscar contenders. The cinematography was cool but there are many creative choices the audience may question. Ultimately it's a film I can appreciate whilst also admitting that I was never really invested in it nor did I particularly enjoy it. Have you seen it? Will you see it? What did you think?","18 December 2023","10/10",NA
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","shaking the past","ferguson-6","Taiçi Yamada is a writer who blends urban alienation with the uncanny in his novels, focusing on intellectual processes and the emotional world of the character rather than events. Throughout his novel, he takes his readers on a mysterious journey through the streets of a city whose inhabitants have almost lost their souls.The novel Strangers made a big impact the year it was first published in Japan, where it was already a closed box. (This was also the first name of this movie, by the way)Author/screenwriter Andrew Haigh was very impressed by the novel, and it is obvious, but his trademark lies in his ability to make autobiographical touches while adapting this novel...Andrew, who has directed three of my favorite DVDs (Weekend - 2011, 45 Years - 2015, Lean on Pete - 2017), has brought the story from the grayness of Japan and the Japanese people to London in a magnificent way.Andrew Scott, Paul Mescal and Jamie Bell, three names he has followed since the very beginning of their careers, show the audience what an actor can add from himself when he loves the story.I haven't seen Andrew Scott this committed since Steel Country, where he was so possessive that he was willing to pay a pittance.To make a long story short, I am writing these while listening to Frankie Goes to Hollywood's Welcome to the Pleasuredome record and the song The Power of Love sounds heavier than before...I hope Sony and Disney will bring this movie to a wider audience through streaming, blu-ray, vod sales etc.","10 February 2024","8/10",NA

"All of Us Strangers (2023)","Always on my mind is now one of favorite songs!","UniqueParticle","All of Us Strangers is one of the most tender love stories put to film in recent memory and a frightening number of people will choose not to see it because it is a gay one at that. Just thought I'd disclose this aspect upfront so that only the worthy stick around for this read. We good? Good.Directed by Andrew Haigh (45 Years) and based in part on the Taichi Yamada novel Strangers, this movie tells of a reclusive London-based screenwriter named Adam (Andrew Scott of Fleabag and Sherlock) who lives in an all-too-quiet apartment building where the only other living soul appears to be the oft-drunk Harry (Paul Mescal of Aftersun), who begins to act flirtily towards him. As you may have guessed, the two eventually bond and fall in love, even as Adam finds Harry a bit mysterious at first and, partly due to what he was taught re: sexuality as a youngster, isn't as comfortable with intimate touch -- initially.Sheila O'Malley put it best when she wrote that All of Us Strangers, almost immediately, has a ""surreal, almost supernatural atmosphere"". I don't know how much I ought to give away, but I can tell you it's not for naught. When I say that the apartment building seems strangely quiet, I mean it seems almost unearthly; it is no surprise that the posters make use of the almost entirely dark building where only two windows are lit up -- it is an image that sets the tone.All the same, love is discovered in this setting (this connection, taking place in an eerie realm where connections at first seem impossible, recalls 2015's Anomalisa in a lot of ways) and it isn't long before our hearts are grabbed and then broken. This oft-surreal film is nonetheless very much, devastatingly real.Adam is also troubled by thoughts about his parents (Jamie Bell; Claire Foy) as he keeps revisiting his (ostensibly) abandoned childhood home. He has a series of dreams (or are they dreams?) where he goes through the conversations he wishes he'd had -- the sort of conversations that frankly a lot of people, be they gay children of traditionally-minded parents or not, wish they'd had with their folks; the sort of conversations we typically don't get around to before it's too late, resorting to having them in our heads, sometimes in the form of revisiting moments and trying against all logic to rewrite them.These sequences exemplify some of the best and most emotionally honest acting of the past year. It is one of those films that make you realize how good other films aren't, particularly those of the romance variety that too often settle for tried routines and formulas while rarely doing anything stylistically intriguing or letting the actors be truly vulnerable. (I'm aware, painfully so, that that's what the crowds want; the statement I heard from a rom-com fan in high school, that ""film is about hot people and satisfying endings"", still echoes in my mind.)On a similar note: as many viewers of British/English cinema will point out, this one sticks out with its artful compositions (note especially its usage of mirrors and windows), dreamlike editing, deliberate color choices, and occasional magical realism. This isn't a first or anything, but it seems we often associate English film with gritty realism -- think This is England or Billy Elliot. I assure you, though, that the English are quite capable of outstanding visual communication. There are edits and framing/blocking choices in All of Us Strangers that cut even deeper than that one ""reveal"" in 45 Years. If you know, you know.Oh and of course, as a long-time fan of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, I can't forget to mention how the film uses their 1984 album Beyond the Pleasuredome, particularly their best song ""The Power of Love"", as a reoccurring motif; a devastating one. The music video is also referenced, in ways I cannot reveal here. Best you go see this wonderful picture before I say too much.And remember: let yourself be beautiful.","31 January 2024","9/10",NA

"All of Us Strangers (2023)","One Powerful punch","joebnow","All of us Strangers tells the story of screenwriter Adam who has a chance encounter with Harry from his tower block during a fire alarm. What follows is an exploration of Adam's life, namely the impact of losing his parents at a young age and growing up with a secret that he withheld from his parents and those close to him. The story is told through Adam seemingly visiting his childhood home and speaking to his parents about the life he has lived as well as through present day conversations with Harry. The way this is portrayed may confuse some audience members.The film touches on loss, loneliness, acceptance and grief. It's well acted and I enjoyed that the film was shot in a local London area that I'm familiar with. Seeing familiar spots, train journeys and local shopping centres was a cool touch for such a well-received film. I appreciate the film's themes however I wasn't as engrossed or touched the film as most films goers were which is a shame. It is one of those films where if it pulls you in, it will take you on deep ride but if it doesn't, it can become a bit of a slog due to its testing pace. This was surprising as it's was the first sub two hour theatre experience of the year but it felt just as long as most of the Oscar contenders. The cinematography was cool but there are many creative choices the audience may question. Ultimately it's a film I can appreciate whilst also admitting that I was never really invested in it nor did I particularly enjoy it. Have you seen it? Will you see it?

I feel like a dolt for missing the clues leading to the twist, and I feel like I would appreciate the movie much more on a second viewing.But even with that, this movie knocked the wind out of me. Or at least part of it did. There are really two stories playing out in this film. In one, a man is able through some unexplained bit of magical realism to return to his family home where his parents, who died when he was twelve, are alive. These scenes are painfully poignant, and Andrew Scott gives a masterclass of acting as a man who is also still in some ways a little boy. A couple of moments with his parents, played well by Jamie Bell and Claire Foy, had me and the rest of the theatre I was in openly weeping.The other story is the one that somehow went over my head, a romance Scott's character strikes up with a man living in his apartment building, played by Paul Mescal. I wasn't into this storyline as much, and would have been content if the entire film had just been about Scott seeking closure with his parents. But again, I also didn't catch on what was actually happening with the Paul Mescal storyline, so I wonder if I would like that part of the film more on a re-watch knowing what I know now.If there's any justice in the world, Andrew Scott will receive some awards attention for this.Grade: A.","14 January 2024","8/10",NA

Such is the case with writer-director Andrew Haigh's latest offering, a heartwarming and heartbreaking story of love, reflection and healing all rolled into one. To say too much about the film would invariably lead to a plethora of spoilers, but suffice it to say that it tells a genuinely moving and touching tale of a 30-something gay Londoner (Andrew Scott) and his budding relationship with a mysterious new beau (Paul Mescal), an involvement very much influenced by the protagonist's relationship with his own past, most notably his involvement with his parents (Jamie Bell, Claire Foy). This is one of those pictures that's just about perfect in virtually every regard thanks to its stringent adherence to authenticity in the writing and the portrayals of its positively stellar cast, especially the highly underrated performance by Foy, whose role has puzzlingly been flying under the radar thus far. It's also a production that will likely surprise viewers in myriad ways, defying expectations and telling a story that's anything but apparent from what's in its promotional trailer. Moreover, I'm impressed by the fact that this is an offering featuring gay characters in which their sexuality is not the principal focus of the narrative, something that truly distinguishes this feature from so many others in this genre.

I have very rarely experienced such magnificent acting as Paul Mescena and Andrew Scott give us here. But I don't think the message would have been as real without Andrew Haigh's script and the lead actors. That these two actors and the film are not included in the Oscar nominations this year is shocking. They give it their all in this film, and take us viewers on a journey about alienation, loneliness and, not least, how to live on after great losses.In addition to excellent acting, a strong message, Andrew Haigh has also provided excellent music, a journey back in time for me as a youth in the 80s.

"All of Us Strangers (2023)","""Don't let this get tangled up again.""","masonsaul","All of Us StrangersI am writing this review 6 hours after I watched it. I originally wanted to think on it more, but I decided that a raw response is necessary to such a raw film.Adam, a screenwriter in London, is attempting to write about his parents who died before his 12th birthday in a car crash. After he evacuates his apartment due to a false alarm, he catches the eye of Harry, another tenant of the building. After initially rebuffing Harry due to his heavy intoxication, Adam starts to open up about his parents to him.While this is going on, Adam begins traveling to his hometown where he discovers his parents, alive and well, but the same age as they were when they died. They immediately recognize him as their middle aged son, and spend the next several weeks learning about his life after their death while also discovering how he felt as a closeted gay kid in the 1980s.Who would not want a chance to speak to loved ones who were taken away too soon? Wouldn't one also play and replay conversations that could never be? Adam even tells his mother about how he did that in the years after their deaths, while ironically speaking to a dead woman.One of the main themes presented is loneliness. Adam was lonely as a kid who could not talk to his parents about either being gay, or about why he was being bullied. Adam was, and still is, lonely after his parents' death. He speaks of failed relationships in such vague terms that one wonders if he had any at all, especially after he admits to Harry that it's been a while since he's been intimate with a man. He continues opening up to Harry, allowing him to be taken out clubbing, dancing and sleeping over.Another main theme reveals itself in Adam's mental illness, specifically in his coping with depression. He listens to old music from his childhood, specifically The Power of Love by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, shown in the film more than once. He tells stories of himself to Harry, who listens attentively and holds him at night during bad dreams. All the while, he sneaks off to his childhood home, where he continues to speak to his dead parents.I admit that I had trouble writing the final paragraph of my review. The movie was already emotional throughout its entirety. What happens in the last few minutes completely changed everything. I can't write down what I'm feeling without spoiling the movie. However, I will write that the ending can only be described as stunning and beautiful.","16 January 2024","10/10",NA

"All of Us Strangers (2023)","Always on my mind is now one of favorite songs!","UniqueParticle","All of Us Strangers is one of the most tender love stories put to film in recent memory and a frightening number of people will choose not to see it because it is a gay one at that. Just thought I'd disclose this aspect upfront so that only the worthy stick around for this read. We good? Good.Directed by Andrew Haigh (45 Years) and based in part on the Taichi Yamada novel Strangers, this movie tells of a reclusive London-based screenwriter named Adam (Andrew Scott of Fleabag and Sherlock) who lives in an all-too-quiet apartment building where the only other living soul appears to be the oft-drunk Harry (Paul Mescal of Aftersun), who begins to act flirtily towards him. As you may have guessed, the two eventually bond and fall in love, even as Adam finds Harry a bit mysterious at first and, partly due to what he was taught re: sexuality as a youngster, isn't as comfortable with intimate touch -- initially.Sheila O'Malley put it best when she wrote that All of Us Strangers, almost immediately, has a ""surreal, almost supernatural atmosphere"". I don't know how much I ought to give away, but I can tell you it's not for naught. When I say that the apartment building seems strangely quiet, I mean it seems almost unearthly; it is no surprise that the posters make use of the almost entirely dark building where only two windows are lit up -- it is an image that sets the tone.All the same, love is discovered in this setting (this connection, taking place in an eerie realm where connections at first seem impossible, recalls 2015's Anomalisa in a lot of ways) and it isn't long before our hearts are grabbed and then broken. This oft-surreal film is nonetheless very much, devastatingly real.Adam is also troubled by thoughts about his parents (Jamie Bell; Claire Foy) as he keeps revisiting his (ostensibly) abandoned childhood home. He has a series of dreams (or are they dreams?) where he goes through the conversations he wishes he'd had -- the sort of conversations that frankly a lot of people, be they gay children of traditionally-minded parents or not, wish they'd had with their folks; the sort of conversations we typically don't get around to before it's too late, resorting to having them in our heads, sometimes in the form of revisiting moments and trying against all logic to rewrite them.These sequences exemplify some of the best and most emotionally honest acting of the past year. It is one of those films that make you realize how good other films aren't, particularly those of the romance variety that too often settle for tried routines and formulas while rarely doing anything stylistically intriguing or letting the actors be truly vulnerable. (I'm aware, painfully so, that that's what the crowds want; the statement I heard from a rom-com fan in high school, that ""film is about hot people and satisfying endings"", still echoes in my mind.)On a similar note: as many viewers of British/English cinema will point out, this one sticks out with its artful compositions (note especially its usage of mirrors and windows), dreamlike editing, deliberate color choices, and occasional magical realism. This isn't a first or anything, but it seems we often associate English film with gritty realism -- think This is England or Billy Elliot. I assure you, though, that the English are quite capable of outstanding visual communication. There are edits and framing/blocking choices in All of Us Strangers that cut even deeper than that one ""reveal"" in 45 Years. If you know, you know.Oh and of course, as a long-time fan of Frankie Goes to Hollywood, I can't forget to mention how the film uses their 1984 album Beyond the Pleasuredome, particularly their best song ""The Power of Love"", as a reoccurring motif; a devastating one. The music video is also referenced, in ways I cannot reveal here. Best you go see this wonderful picture before I say too much.And remember: let yourself be beautiful.","31 January 2024","9/10",NA

"All of Us Strangers (2023)","Metaphysical Tearjerker","evanston_dad","Ok, I feel like I have to go back and watch this one again already after reading some interpretations of the ending. I feel like a dolt for missing the clues leading to the twist, and I feel like I would appreciate the movie much more on a second viewing.But even with that, this movie knocked the wind out of me. Or at least part of it did. There are really two stories playing out in this film. In one, a man is able through some unexplained bit of magical realism to return to his family home where his parents, who died when he was twelve, are alive. These scenes are painfully poignant, and Andrew Scott gives a masterclass of acting as a man who is also still in some ways a little boy. A couple of moments with his parents, played well by Jamie Bell and Claire Foy, had me and the rest of the theatre I was in openly weeping.The other story is the one that somehow went over my head, a romance Scott's character strikes up with a man living in his apartment building, played by Paul Mescal. I wasn't into this storyline as much, and would have been content if the entire film had just been about Scott seeking closure with his parents. But again, I also didn't catch on what was actually happening with the Paul Mescal storyline, so I wonder if I would like that part of the film more on a re-watch knowing what I know now.If there's any justice in the world, Andrew Scott will receive some awards attention for this.Grade: A.","14 January 2024","8/10",NA
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","A Near Perfect Film on So Many Fronts","brentsbulletinboard","In a movie awards season that has had more misses than hits, it's gratifying to see one that not only lives up to, but exceeds, its potential. Such is the case with writer-director Andrew Haigh's latest offering, a heartwarming and heartbreaking story of love, reflection and healing all rolled into one. To say too much about the film would invariably lead to a plethora of spoilers, but suffice it to say that it tells a genuinely moving and touching tale of a 30-something gay Londoner (Andrew Scott) and his budding relationship with a mysterious new beau (Paul Mescal), an involvement very much influenced by the protagonist's relationship with his own past, most notably his involvement with his parents (Jamie Bell, Claire Foy). This is one of those pictures that's just about perfect in virtually every regard thanks to its stringent adherence to authenticity in the writing and the portrayals of its positively stellar cast, especially the highly underrated performance by Foy, whose role has puzzlingly been flying under the radar thus far. It's also a production that will likely surprise viewers in myriad ways, defying expectations and telling a story that's anything but apparent from what's in its promotional trailer. Moreover, I'm impressed by the fact that this is an offering featuring gay characters in which their sexuality is not the principal focus of the narrative, something that truly distinguishes this feature from so many others in this genre. Add to these attributes a sensitively chosen soundtrack and some surprisingly innovative cinematography, and you've got one helluva fine movie. To be sure, this is one of those releases that, if it doesn't touch you profoundly, you'd better check to see if you have ice water coursing through your veins. ""All of Us Strangers"" richly deserves whatever accolades it receives. It's one of the year's best, bar none.","24 February 2024","9/10",NA
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","I will never forget this film","dakjets","How on earth will I manage to find the right words to describe the cinematic experience this film gave me? (English is not my mother tongue) I still have to try.I remember Liv Ullmann in a lecture talking about the film Persona. She said a movie doesn't have to explain everything to you. Give all answers. But instead give you something that you take with you and think about. Maybe after a while you think; aha, that's how it was! She also said that a film can change you, and give you new perspectives. I think that is a summary I can share with her about this special, beautiful and profound film.For me, who also lost my parents at an early age, the film's message about loss and coming to terms with loss was right at the center of my heart. I have very rarely experienced such magnificent acting as Paul Mescena and Andrew Scott give us here. But I don't think the message would have been as real without Andrew Haigh's script and the lead actors. That these two actors and the film are not included in the Oscar nominations this year is shocking. They give it their all in this film, and take us viewers on a journey about alienation, loneliness and, not least, how to live on after great losses.In addition to excellent acting, a strong message, Andrew Haigh has also provided excellent music, a journey back in time for me as a youth in the 80s. Rarely has the maligned pop music of this decade come into its own more than in this masterpiece.I will never forget this film.","29 January 2024","10/10",NA
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","I have questions and concerns and yet it's the most moving movie I've seen in years.","tom-640","All of Us Strangers is filled with beautiful lines like that which is one of the main reasons it's such an emotional film. Exploring how moving on is such an important part of dealing with a traumatic experience, and often the hardest part. It's designed to warm the heart almost as many times as it'll break it.Andrew Scott portrays his character's sadness and quietness in such a natural fashion, making every emotional moment that much more impactful. Paul Mescal once again provides a charming exterior to hide his own pain and when he's with Scott their chemistry is ridiculously palpable.Claire Foy and Jamie Bell are pretty much perfect at portraying 1980s parents. Everything from what they say to the way they say it feels incredibly accurate and seeing them react to the revelations of how times have changed since then leads to some of the most emotional heart to hearts.Andrew Haigh's direction excels because of the tenderness. There's so much time put into showing the smaller yet vital parts of the growing connection between everyone and the lighting imbues everything with a stunning glow. The soundtrack is full of ideal choices but the final song is particularly devastating.","27 January 2024","9/10",NA
"All of Us Strangers (2023)","""Don't let this get tangled up again.""","masonsaul","All of Us StrangersI am writing this review 6 hours after I watched it. I originally wanted to think on it more, but I decided that a raw response is necessary to such a raw film.Adam, a screenwriter in London, is attempting to write about his parents who died before his 12th birthday in a car crash. After he evacuates his apartment due to a false alarm, he catches the eye of Harry, another tenant of the building. After initially rebuffing Harry due to his heavy intoxication, Adam starts to open up about his parents to him.While this is going on, Adam begins traveling to his hometown where he discovers his parents, alive and well, but the same age as they were when they died. They immediately recognize him as their middle aged son, and spend the next several weeks learning about his life after their death while also discovering how he felt as a closeted gay kid in the 1980s.Who would not want a chance to speak to loved ones who were taken away too soon? Wouldn't one also play and replay conversations that could never be? Adam even tells his mother about how he did that in the years after their deaths, while ironically speaking to a dead woman.One of the main themes presented is loneliness. Adam was lonely as a kid who could not talk to his parents about either being gay, or about why he was being bullied. Adam was, and still is, lonely after his parents' death. He speaks of failed relationships in such vague terms that one wonders if he had any at all, especially after he admits to Harry that it's been a while since he's been intimate with a man. He continues opening up to Harry, allowing him to be taken out clubbing, dancing and sleeping over.Another main theme reveals itself in Adam's mental illness, specifically in his coping with depression.

"The Holdovers (2023)","Deep Inside People's Hearts","aharmas","Here is a film that feels and looks like something out of the early seventies. The Holdovers is a strong and warm-hearted piece that gives actors roles with powerful lines, without any reliance on flashy editing and being overwhelmed by special effects.The story is simple three people get stuck for the Christmas holidays in a boarding school. It's cold, lonely, and boring for the parties involved. The adults drink to cope with whatever pressures they live with. The young man resorts to bad behavior and altercations with the teacher in charge.Through the vacation period these people will get to interact and get to know each other, something that will prove to a challenge to say the least. As the story evolves, we get to understand what has made the people who they are. We get to feel their pain and frustration through the very insightful writing of the director.It's a strong film with superb acting by the main leads. They have great chemistry together.Most outstanding is Paul Giamatti who plays the tormented and defensive man with relish and speaks volumes with his eyes.Hope the academy honors his performance as the best the year because no one else so far is coming close.","29 October 2023","10/10",NA
"The Holdovers (2023)","One of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as one of the best of the year","darkreignn","Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it.","20 November 2023","9/10",NA
"The Holdovers (2023)","Sobbed Through Most of This Movie","evanston_dad","Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have.

"The Holdovers (2023)","Life Affirming...","Xstal","Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored.","10 November 2023","8/10",NA
"The Holdovers (2023)","""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie","steiner-sam","It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie.","16 November 2023","9/10",NA
"The Holdovers (2023)","One of the best movies of the year.","JohnDeSando","""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham.","6 November 2023","8/10",NA
"The Holdovers (2023)","Throwback filmmaking.","dtswpod","Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given.

"The Holdovers (2023)","entre nous","ferguson-6","""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating.

"The Holdovers (2023)","A Nostalgic Journey with Stellar Performances","akcenat","The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As?

"The Holdovers (2023)","One of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as one of the best of the year","darkreignn","Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it.","20 November 2023","9/10",NA
"The Holdovers (2023)","Sobbed Through Most of This Movie","evanston_dad","Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have.

"The Holdovers (2023)","Sobbed Through Most of This Movie","evanston_dad","Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+","28 November 2023","10/10",NA

"The Holdovers (2023)","""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie","steiner-sam","It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie.","16 November 2023","9/10",NA
"The Holdovers (2023)","One of the best movies of the year.","JohnDeSando","""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham.","6 November 2023","8/10",NA

I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given.

"The Holdovers (2023)","entre nous","ferguson-6","""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth.

"The Holdovers (2023)","A Nostalgic Journey with Stellar Performances","akcenat","The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As?

"The Holdovers (2023)","One of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as one of the best of the year","darkreignn","Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie.

"The Holdovers (2023)","One of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as one of the best of the year","darkreignn","Let's just get this out of the way now - when it comes to writing this review, I'm probably a little bit biased (and a little bit drunk, currently, but that's besides the point). You see, I have an affinity for indie coming of age movies, and ""The Holdovers"" is basically an indie coming of age film, so it may - or may not - come as a surprise to you that I absolutely adored this picture. So, with that little preface out of the way, it's time for me to gush over this movie.Starring none other than Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, Giamatti plays a professor at an all boys boarding school where, over Christmas break, he has the misfortune of looking over a group of boys, one of whom is named Angus, played by Dominic Sessa. After a rocky start, where Paul clearly doesn't get along with any of the boys, making his disdain clear and evident, he eventually finds himself alone with Angus - as well as with the school's cook, Mary Lamb, played by Da'Vine Joy Randolph - in an unexpected chain of events. What occurs after is a slice-of-life style piece of cinema that allows broken people to find comfort in each other's company.""The Holdovers"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of 2023, as well as probably one of the best movies of the year, as well. This Christmas-themed gem doesn't hold back on the drama, delivering a thoughtful blend of comedy, coming-of-age storytelling, and a touch of romance - all wrapped around a very raw, human plot-line that virtually everyone can relate to. I'm no spring chicken myself, but I found myself deeply connected to both main characters - one who is older and basically dejected with life as he knows it, and one who is younger but who feels lost, aimless, and disconnected from both family and friends. And admittedly, not everyone will have a direct parallel to these experiences, but even if you don't, you're in for a story that's bound to tug at your heartstrings... and make you laugh out loud in the process.This is a high-quality movie - from the impeccable acting to the beautiful on-location cinematography to the relatable, thought-provoking plot, every element is executed with pinpoint precision and finesse; it's a testament to the art of storytelling on the silver screen. Director Alexander Payne knows how to create an artful film, and ""The Holdovers"" is no exception. It's at once indie and art-house while simultaneously being mainstream and easily accessible; in short, it's a film for everyone that actually feels like a genuine crowdpleaser instead of a pandering mess.I'm having a difficult time describing what I liked about this movie, and the reason is because I liked almost everything about this movie. So why the 9 out of 10 rating instead of the perfect 10? Literally the only thing that's holding me back is because I would've liked a touch more romance; yes, there was romance here, but a bit more would've pushed me over the edge into 10 out of 10 territory. Besides that, this is basically a perfect film, one that I loved, and one that has become one of my favorite movies of the year, if not of all time. I am genuinely looking forward to rewatching this, and I can't wait until it becomes closer to Christmas so I can view this on my own TV, cuddled under blankets, with a glass of whiskey, and bask in the absolute heartwarming experience that is ""The Holdovers."" My recommendation: Do yourself a favor and watch this as soon as you can - you won't regret it.","20 November 2023","9/10",NA
"The Holdovers (2023)","Sobbed Through Most of This Movie","evanston_dad","Mid-way through ""The Holdovers,"" I started openly weeping in the movie theater, and I pretty much kept it up on and off for the rest of the movie. Sometimes, there wasn't even anything obviously sad or moving happening in the scene, and I still couldn't stop. I think it's because this movie is so kind, and kindness is a rare commodity these days. It's sad to think that a movie about characters learning to have compassion for each other and for the hardships they've been through should feel like such a rare beast, but here we are.This is Alexander Payne firing on all cylinders as a director, and though he didn't write this movie, it feels like he could have. It's an obvious throwback to the kinds of movies Hal Ashby made throughout the 1970s and is touching in exactly the same way ""Harold and Maude"" was. It's also a master class in acting from the three principal characters played by Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, and Da 'Vine Joy Randolph, and I hope all three of them, and the movie overall, is remembered come Oscar time.This will easily make my top ten list for the year.Grade: A+","28 November 2023","10/10",NA
"The Holdovers (2023)","Life Affirming...","Xstal","Now here's a film with a life affirming theme, that should encourage most viewers to think of their dreams, and cascade away all their cloaks, inhibitions, and open fresh doors to their heart's intuitions; as a teacher whose life is as stale as dead fish, whose life is the opposite of happy and bliss, meets a boy who's ignored by all those he holds dear, and a friendship is formed that is warm and sincere; it's a subtle reflection of how we get trapped, by tradition and habits and past circumstance, where surroundings like prisons can temper our thinking, to distil all our spirit, to bottles for drinking; so embrace all the chances when they come along, break out of that mould and sing your own song, open your eyes to the paths unexplored, take a stand and stand tall, and stop being ignored.","10 November 2023","8/10",NA
"The Holdovers (2023)","""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie","steiner-sam","It's a comedy-drama set from December 16, 1970, to the first week of January 1971 in an exclusive boy's boarding school in New England and Boston, Massachusetts. It follows the experiences of the ""holdovers,"" that is, the students who cannot go home over the Christmas holidays and the two Barton staff left to supervise them during the holidays.There are five holdovers: Teddy Kountze (Brady Hepner), Jason Smith (Michael Provost), and Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa) are upper-class wealthy WASP students. Alex Ollerman (Ian Dolley) is a younger Mormon student whose parents are on a mission in South America. Ye-Joon Park (Jim Kaplan) is from South Korea.Left to supervise is Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), an unmarried ancient history teacher who was once a student at Barton and has taught there all his career. He's a demanding curmudgeon who almost everyone dislikes. African American Mary Lamb (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the head cook, is also present; her son, a Barton grad, has just been killed in Vietnam.The film follows the shared experiences of the holdovers, though four students leave after a week when a wealthy father takes them for a ski holiday. Paul cannot contact Angus's parents, so he must stay with Paul and Mary at Barton. We also meet the school's headmaster, Hardy Woodrup (Andrew Garman), his administrative assistant, Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), and janitor Danny (Naheem Garcia).""The Holdovers"" is a delightful comedy leavened with wisdom as we learn the dark secrets that have shaped Paul Hunham and Angus Tully. Giamatti, Sessa, and Randolph are all excellent. The script unfolds the twists and turns superbly. ""The Holdovers"" is a great Christmas movie.","16 November 2023","9/10",NA
"The Holdovers (2023)","One of the best movies of the year.","JohnDeSando","""I find the world a bitter and complicated place. And it seems to feel the same way about me."" Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti)Teaching privileged boys at an elite new England prep school called Barton (think for example, Philips Exeter), might be the pinnacle of an academic's career. But not Paul Hunham in The Holdovers, an elite movie itself of the year.Paul should be teaching classics at an ivy school, not teaching entitled ""vermin,"" among the many sobriquets he tosses around about the fortunate young men to experience his brand of grumpy intellectualism and misanthropy. He prepares them for a world that won't always be coddling and protecting them as their family wealth so naturally does in their early years.Director Alexander Payne worked with Giamatti in Sideways, so he is prepared to have another winning cynical character who is endearing while distanced by negative temperament from normally positive fellow humans (Paul's last name, Hunham, suggests a distant connection with the better angels of humanity).As Paul accepts the assignment to supervise holdovers (exiled to Christmas vacation in the absence of parents or guardians), the number whittles down to just Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, reminiscent of young, Timothy Chalamet and Adam Driver), who shares Paul's dark attitudes and, with the sharp writing of David Hemingson, some witty dialogue- e.g., about Paul he says, ""I thought all of the Nazis had left for Argentina.""Although, as in likeminded dramas such as Dead Poet's Society or Goodbye, Mr. Chips, the principals are destined to be transformed into more humane characters, Holdovers continues, even in its denouement, to accentuate the unsunny side of life for Paul and Tully, whose fortunes are still compromised by cold-hearted parents and administrators. The chilly world, however, is warmed on these lovely, snowbound days, by women, viz., the cook, Mary (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and administrator Lydia (Carrie Preston).Mary good-naturedly deals with the death of her son, Curtis, a Barton grad who had to join the military because he did not have the resources as other Barton grads of the late '60s did to avoid the draft.Lydia, an attractive middle-aged staff member, holds the promise of a love interest for Paul, only to show how difficult it is for social exiles to enter the romantic mainstream.The Holdovers is a small gem of a move that will immediately remind buffs about Hal Ashby comedies of the same era like Harold & Maude, where character development is paramount and detachment from the mainstream is required to look at humanity clearly with its foibles and endearments.The Holdovers is a movie everyone can enjoy with endearing characters who share with us our moments about loneliness peppered with the possibilities of love and happiness.""Do you think I want to be babysitting you? No. I was praying your mother would pick up the phone, or your father would arrive in a helicopter or a flying saucer...."" Paul Hunham.","6 November 2023","8/10",NA
"The Holdovers (2023)","Throwback filmmaking.","dtswpod","Do you miss how they used to make films in the 1970s? Plenty of filmmakers do, except they take that nostalgia and just do watered down versions of better movies. As an example see Taxi Driver and King of Comedy then watch Joker and you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, Alexander Payne has managed to take his sentimentality and make an original film out of it. Or if The Holdovers is a pale imitation of a superior picture then the filmmaker has managed to trick me because I don't feel as if I've seen this movie before but done better.Now to be clear, there aren't things you've never seen before in the movie. I mean, you know the characters are going to bond at some point. And people will grow to care about each other. That's a given. How we get there, however, is what makes the film seem fresh and entertaining and ever bit as good as any flick made back in the day.I hope more people see it.","7 December 2023","8/10",NA

"The Holdovers (2023)","entre nous","ferguson-6","""The Holdovers"" is a captivating blend of comedy and drama that beautifully explores the complexities of human relationships.Story is about a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who forms an unexpected bond with a troubled student during the Christmas break. Because it is set in the 1970s, the film in a way is a nostalgic journey back in time, but with a narrative that is both engaging and thought-provoking.The performances are exceptional, with Giamatti delivering a compelling portrayal of a man grappling with his own loneliness and the challenges of mentorship. The film's narrative is richly layered, exploring themes of loneliness, friendship, and personal growth. It's a story that resonates, offering a poignant reflection on the human condition. The film's setting in the 1970s adds a layer of nostalgia, further enhancing the emotional depth of the narrative. Despite its lengthy runtime, ""The Holdovers"" mostly maintains a steady pace, balancing its dramatic elements with moments of humor and warmth. The main plus of the movie is its dialogue-driven approach that adds to its charm, creating a sense of authenticity and depth in its character interactions.Overall, this is a film that leaves a lasting impression, offering a thoughtful exploration of human relationships set against the backdrop of a bygone era. With its exceptional performances and engaging narrative, I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 rating. It's a must-watch for those seeking a film that combines drama, comedy, and a touch of nostalgia.","1 January 2024","8/10",NA
"The Holdovers (2023)","A Nostalgic Journey with Stellar Performances","akcenat","The Holdovers is, for all of the character dynamics and dysfunction and depression and other things we find out about the leads, mostly with Mr. Hunham and Angus and how their characters over these couple of weeks turn away from the ""Barton"" way of not telling lies (because, well, sometimes context and the moment matter for telling a lie that won't really hurt, maybe), a strangely comforting film to watch. Not for all of that exactly, though what we understand slowly but surely is this is all material for comedy and tragedy in equal measure, but because of the feeling that we get with a filmmaker who is so primed and confident with material that you don't feel like it can go wrong.What is more impressive is that, as enjoyable as the first half is, it is in the ""I like this"" mode as we are introduced to this world and Hunham and Angus and Mary, but it doesn't feel so special. But I should have known Payne and writer David Hemingson were laying down the necessary groundwork for what comes the moment a) the majority of the other supporting characters leave for reasons I don't have to mention here, and b) then the characters go outside the Barton campus grounds on a holiday party and then a ""field trip"" to Boston, you get the sense moment by moment and interaction by interaction it is so sharp and cutting and wise, and one scene in particular makes the jump into ""oh, OK, this is taking off into another level of personal pain and about familial expectations and what will come with in a life measuring up to others - and why that is wrong - and... yeah, it's great"" territory.In other words, it's the kind of film I want to watch again right away simply because now that I know a little more about the characters, I'll want to experience all of the extra textures (its 1970 down to the wood paneling and the car seats), and dig a little more into those absolutely wonderful natural restrained and complete performances - we take Giamatti for granted sometimes and this is a character he should be proud of to craft, lazy-ass eyes and all; Sessa's first role and he is an immediate star; I can't be more sure of anything for the next Oscar's that, if Randolph is nominated, she will win, if nothing else for everything she does at the Christmas party scenes, and a moment looking over some objects in a room later on is so moving - and my comfort is in seeing Payne clearly loving directing this intimate character study where he can show what a comedically observant, quick witted, and heartbreaking story this all is.It's one of the best Christmas movies in several years, embodying many themes and ideals that fit like a 70s wool sweater, and I'm sure the first thing Payne must have thought after reading the script was ""whoa. This is gonna be the best Hal Ashby or Bob Rafelson movie never made... is 'The Last Holdover' too on the nose?"" Even Hunham would give this... a B+ probably (did he ever give As? Shrug).","30 October 2023","10/10",NA
"The Iron Claw (2023)","""You never heard of the curse of the Von Erichs?""","classicsoncall","The Von Erich's were always this odd story I heard when I was a kid. The wrestling family that kicked off what is now the professional wrestling dynasty. They were the superstars that also saddled with one of the darkest most bizarre curse. If you think about the tragedy of Chris Benoit, someone would always bring up the Von Erich's.The story is centered around Kevin Von Erich (Zac Efron), mostly because the tale can only be told through his window. A Texas family whose father Fritz (Holt McCallany) desperately wanted to be at the top of the game. He molded his sons to follow in his footsteps. Cold and focused, he is the father of that era that most today would consider abusive. Back then, to get greatness, sacrifice must be endured. In this case, the early wild death of the eldest brother Jack (who is never really addressed completely) since he was a baby when he passed from an electrocution accident. From that point on, the family presses forward.There is a dark cloud that hangs over the family, yet no one completely addresses it directly. The Von Erich curse seemed to be a real thing. And as a youngster, I always waited for the next Von Erich to die a weird death. Grim as it may seem.The brothers wake up and eat, drink and breathe wrestling. But there is a hierarchy. Broken down by the Fritz. The brothers are meant to compete with each other for the approval of Dad.There is also David (Harris Dickinson) and Kerry (Jeremy Allan White) but not mentioned...a brother Chris. I only knew Kerry, since he made it to the WWF.This at-the-fringe federation of wrestlers were in the NWA, which I always considered the low-rent of wrestling, as if there were such a thing.Kevin marries Pam (Lily James) who is really the most normal of the gang. The mother. Doris (Maura Tierney) seems to be just trying to placate Fritz but also focus on God.I truly miss this type of filmmaking. It is a story of family and tragedy and how they cope with it. Which sometimes I wish they showed more of that and less of the wrestling. This movie's emotional core stuck with me. Though, there are moments that drag, when you think about how awful events followed this family, you are left wondering how they were able to move forward.The answer isn't very clear. These are the moments I wish focused more on Kevin's resilience. Instead, we see he truly believes the family curse. And that would be enough. Perhaps the emotionally absent mother answers the question of pain and loss. There is a great moment when all the death occurs, Mom doesn't know how to cope. Because of her faith, you read the thought bubble which is asking God ""why am I being tested"" a brilliant move by director Sean Durkin NOT to have her say this outloud.One thing that may trouble some viewers is the Fritz's dialogue. At first, I considered it horrible acting. Then it occurred to me. He has been a showboat to audiences most his life. It isn't too far of a stretch that he knows no other way to communicate. He is a tough guy who relies on his sons to be equally as tough. Though he isn't that way at first, he downshifts into it with the success of the family.There's so much to unpack here.Mass kudos to Zac Efron. A brilliant piece of acting which should get him an Oscar nom (perhaps the Academy will never take him seriously...they should). In spite of his stoic mannerisms, Efron still exudes thought processes. In this case, tough guys aren't suppose to cry. But we cry for him.Wonderful work. This is a must to see in theaters. A small screen will not show the subtle performances.","23 December 2023","8/10",NA
"The Iron Claw (2023)","Heartbreaking Cursed Family","statuskuo","The Iron Claw is incredible yet devastating. It's an emotionally haunting film that is going to stick with me for a while. The film delves into the tragic story of the Von Erich family with the utmost reverence, and while I know next to nothing about wrestling, this movie destroyed me. It's a heavy watch that might be the most moving, profound, and honest depiction of family on film this year. Sean Durkin takes an unfathomably tragic story and tells it with needed grace. Zac Efron gives an absolutely touching and heartbreaking performance as Kevin Von Erich. He delivers his most physically and emotionally demanding performance to date, supported by a flawless cast ensemble as they, along with director Sean Durkin, commit to some of the best depictions of wrestling ever seen on film. The Iron Claw is gut-wrenching and beautiful all at the same time, telling a tragic story of brotherhood, love, pain, expectations, favouritism, and legacy.

It feels like something out of a Greek tragedy or Stephen King novel. Unfortunately, it's neither: this is the story of an obsessive and unfeeling man who forced his failed dreams onto each of his sons ... and the catastrophes it caused...
Everyone who talks about ""The Iron Claw"" is going to rave about how great of a job Zac Efron and Jeremy Allen White are in this (and don't get me wrong, they're PHENOMENAL), but I was especially blown away by Harris Dickinson's portrayal of David Von Erich; he carried every scene he was in with a larger-than-life, yet supportive persona.""The Iron Claw"" is more than good enough to earn a couple of Oscar nominations next year ... but based on the recently released shortlist and strong competition, I doubt it's going to make it.Regardless, I still recommend this unbelievable and emotional movie.

In terms of drama, Efron is subtle mostly, but really shines in the final scene of the movie.The pace is just about perfect. There is no meandering or long drawn out sequences that make you want to check the time. There are a few jumps in years but you don't get confused how much time has passed, keeping the audience engaged and not figuring out timelines.The movie is based on a true story and has a lot of tragic moments, but there is also hope which helps balance the tone.

The motives and decisions of all the characters were well executed. The wrestling scenes were well done even though this film was less about wrestling and more about the family.While I enjoyed this film, I did feel that it could have been longer. Some of the events felt rushed and crammed together. More major wrestling events should have been added to show some of the wrestling politics. The wives in the film played very minimal roles in the film and it was hard to believe that they weren't more involved in real life.With that said this was still a gripping and memorable film that deserves to be watched.","23 December 2023","8/10",NA
"The Iron Claw (2023)","Solid 10","austinbeyondcompare","Oh well, looks like I might be in the minority here - but what is all the fuss about?

His sons ""Kevin"" (Zac Efron) and ""David"" (Harrison Dicksinson) are destined to work for a shot at the world title, ""Kerry"" (Jeremy Allen White) for Olympic glory and finally ""Mike"" (Stanley Simons) - the more creative, musically minded, one brings up the rear. President Jimmy Carter and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan puts paid to the Olympic ambitions and so now the three siblings can work together to climb the rankings in Texas and maybe earn a shot at the world title. Meantime, plastic Zac falls in love with Pam (Lily James) and it's at their wedding that Kevin discovers his dad's favourite (David) might not be doing so well. Tragedy ensues, indeed an whole slew of tragedies follow the Von Erich family as their dogged pursuit of glory causes the family to reel from one disaster to another - without anyone seeming to learn from it! Now as family dramas go, it's a sad story - no doubt about that. As a piece of cinema, it merely marries a fairly mediocre script with living proof that the spirit of method acting is alive and well. Certainly these men have put their bodies through the mill, and the fight scenes do impress - but none of the rest of it looks or feels real. Their characters are under-cooked, the dynamic between the boys and the parents, their mother (Maura Tierney) especially, is scarcely addressed and by the time we reach the historically accurate conclusion, I found myself completely devoid of sympathy or empathy for a family that had no grasp of what was important. There's a touching line at the end about brotherhood, but it was all just too little too late in a story of obsession and ambition that just didn't engage me at all.","22 December 2023","10/10",NA

I am not very familiar with the Von Erich backstory but the movie does a pretty good job on examining the characters and setting with strong directing from Durkin which helped bring the atmosphere and setting to the heights. The writing is the typical biographical structure but it is well-executed because of interesting themes and concepts explored and Durkin's direction. Many of the performances from the cast were pretty great as Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen White, Harris Dickinson and everyone else does a great job on their performances. Holt McCallany as Fritz Von Erich does a great job on portraying how awful of a father Von Erich was.Many of the characters are interesting as the conflicting dynamics between the family, wrestling games, and relationships are interesting and pretty emotional at times. Alongside with the dialogue as well. There are some certain soundtrack choices that were a bit odd and there are some pacing moments that could have improved.

The mother. Doris (Maura Tierney) seems to be just trying to placate Fritz but also focus on God.I truly miss this type of filmmaking. It is a story of family and tragedy and how they cope with it. Which sometimes I wish they showed more of that and less of the wrestling. This movie's emotional core stuck with me. Though, there are moments that drag, when you think about how awful events followed this family, you are left wondering how they were able to move forward.The answer isn't very clear. These are the moments I wish focused more on Kevin's resilience. Instead, we see he truly believes the family curse. And that would be enough. Perhaps the emotionally absent mother answers the question of pain and loss. There is a great moment when all the death occurs, Mom doesn't know how to cope. Because of her faith, you read the thought bubble which is asking God ""why am I being tested"" a brilliant move by director Sean Durkin NOT to have her say this outloud.One thing that may trouble some viewers is the Fritz's dialogue. At first, I considered it horrible acting. Then it occurred to me. He has been a showboat to audiences most his life. It isn't too far of a stretch that he knows no other way to communicate. He is a tough guy who relies on his sons to be equally as tough. Though he isn't that way at first, he downshifts into it with the success of the family.There's so much to unpack here.Mass kudos to Zac Efron. A brilliant piece of acting which should get him an Oscar nom (perhaps the Academy will never take him seriously...they should). In spite of his stoic mannerisms, Efron still exudes thought processes. In this case, tough guys aren't suppose to cry. But we cry for him.Wonderful work. This is a must to see in theaters. A small screen will not show the subtle performances.","23 December 2023","8/10",NA
"The Iron Claw (2023)","Heartbreaking Cursed Family","statuskuo","The Iron Claw is incredible yet devastating. It's an emotionally haunting film that is going to stick with me for a while. The film delves into the tragic story of the Von Erich family with the utmost reverence, and while I know next to nothing about wrestling, this movie destroyed me. It's a heavy watch that might be the most moving, profound, and honest depiction of family on film this year. Sean Durkin takes an unfathomably tragic story and tells it with needed grace. Zac Efron gives an absolutely touching and heartbreaking performance as Kevin Von Erich. He delivers his most physically and emotionally demanding performance to date, supported by a flawless cast ensemble as they, along with director Sean Durkin, commit to some of the best depictions of wrestling ever seen on film. The Iron Claw is gut-wrenching and beautiful all at the same time, telling a tragic story of brotherhood, love, pain, expectations, favouritism, and legacy. I found myself heartbroken by the tragedies portrayed on screen, yet incredibly moved by the brotherhood these characters shared. Hold your loved ones close!","29 December 2023","8/10",NA

"The Iron Claw (2023)","Solid 10","austinbeyondcompare","Oh well, looks like I might be in the minority here - but what is all the fuss about? A domineering patriarch (Holt McCallany) is determined that all four of his sons will succeed in a wrestling ring where he didn't. His sons ""Kevin"" (Zac Efron) and ""David"" (Harrison Dicksinson) are destined to work for a shot at the world title, ""Kerry"" (Jeremy Allen White) for Olympic glory and finally ""Mike"" (Stanley Simons) - the more creative, musically minded, one brings up the rear. President Jimmy Carter and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan puts paid to the Olympic ambitions and so now the three siblings can work together to climb the rankings in Texas and maybe earn a shot at the world title. Meantime, plastic Zac falls in love with Pam (Lily James) and it's at their wedding that Kevin discovers his dad's favourite (David) might not be doing so well. Tragedy ensues, indeed an whole slew of tragedies follow the Von Erich family as their dogged pursuit of glory causes the family to reel from one disaster to another - without anyone seeming to learn from it! Now as family dramas go, it's a sad story - no doubt about that. As a piece of cinema, it merely marries a fairly mediocre script with living proof that the spirit of method acting is alive and well. Certainly these men have put their bodies through the mill, and the fight scenes do impress - but none of the rest of it looks or feels real. Their characters are under-cooked, the dynamic between the boys and the parents, their mother (Maura Tierney) especially, is scarcely addressed and by the time we reach the historically accurate conclusion, I found myself completely devoid of sympathy or empathy for a family that had no grasp of what was important. There's a touching line at the end about brotherhood, but it was all just too little too late in a story of obsession and ambition that just didn't engage me at all.","22 December 2023","10/10",NA

The writing is the typical biographical structure but it is well-executed because of interesting themes and concepts explored and Durkin's direction. Many of the performances from the cast were pretty great as Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen White, Harris Dickinson and everyone else does a great job on their performances. Holt McCallany as Fritz Von Erich does a great job on portraying how awful of a father Von Erich was.Many of the characters are interesting as the conflicting dynamics between the family, wrestling games, and relationships are interesting and pretty emotional at times.

"The Iron Claw (2023)","Whether you're a fan of Pro wrestling or not, you'll love this sad, but amazing film","lopresti-46927","I went into this film not knowing anything about the Von Erich family. I thought this would be a typical sports movie centered around wrestling. Fortunately, this film was more than that. It touched on many topics like brotherhood, father son dynamics and grief. This film was way more tragic than anything I could have thought of and what makes it crazy is that it's all true.The acting was very good in this film and all the relationships were believable except for how quickly Kevin and Pam got together.All of the actors playing the brothers had great chemistry.

The wrestling scenes were well done even though this film was less about wrestling and more about the family.While I enjoyed this film, I did feel that it could have been longer. Some of the events felt rushed and crammed together. More major wrestling events should have been added to show some of the wrestling politics.

"The Iron Claw (2023)","Solid 10","austinbeyondcompare","Oh well, looks like I might be in the minority here - but what is all the fuss about? A domineering patriarch (Holt McCallany) is determined that all four of his sons will succeed in a wrestling ring where he didn't. His sons ""Kevin"" (Zac Efron) and ""David"" (Harrison Dicksinson) are destined to work for a shot at the world title, ""Kerry"" (Jeremy Allen White) for Olympic glory and finally ""Mike"" (Stanley Simons) - the more creative, musically minded, one brings up the rear. President Jimmy Carter and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan puts paid to the Olympic ambitions and so now the three siblings can work together to climb the rankings in Texas and maybe earn a shot at the world title. Meantime, plastic Zac falls in love with Pam (Lily James) and it's at their wedding that Kevin discovers his dad's favourite (David) might not be doing so well. Tragedy ensues, indeed an whole slew of tragedies follow the Von Erich family as their dogged pursuit of glory causes the family to reel from one disaster to another - without anyone seeming to learn from it! Now as family dramas go, it's a sad story - no doubt about that. As a piece of cinema, it merely marries a fairly mediocre script with living proof that the spirit of method acting is alive and well. Certainly these men have put their bodies through the mill, and the fight scenes do impress - but none of the rest of it looks or feels real. Their characters are under-cooked, the dynamic between the boys and the parents, their mother (Maura Tierney) especially, is scarcely addressed and by the time we reach the historically accurate conclusion, I found myself completely devoid of sympathy or empathy for a family that had no grasp of what was important. There's a touching line at the end about brotherhood, but it was all just too little too late in a story of obsession and ambition that just didn't engage me at all.","22 December 2023","10/10",NA

The writing is the typical biographical structure but it is well-executed because of interesting themes and concepts explored and Durkin's direction. Many of the performances from the cast were pretty great as Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen White, Harris Dickinson and everyone else does a great job on their performances. Holt McCallany as Fritz Von Erich does a great job on portraying how awful of a father Von Erich was.Many of the characters are interesting as the conflicting dynamics between the family, wrestling games, and relationships are interesting and pretty emotional at times.

"The Iron Claw (2023)","""You never heard of the curse of the Von Erichs?""","classicsoncall","The Von Erich's were always this odd story I heard when I was a kid. The wrestling family that kicked off what is now the professional wrestling dynasty. They were the superstars that also saddled with one of the darkest most bizarre curse. If you think about the tragedy of Chris Benoit, someone would always bring up the Von Erich's.The story is centered around Kevin Von Erich (Zac Efron), mostly because the tale can only be told through his window. A Texas family whose father Fritz (Holt McCallany) desperately wanted to be at the top of the game. He molded his sons to follow in his footsteps. Cold and focused, he is the father of that era that most today would consider abusive. Back then, to get greatness, sacrifice must be endured. In this case, the early wild death of the eldest brother Jack (who is never really addressed completely) since he was a baby when he passed from an electrocution accident. From that point on, the family presses forward.There is a dark cloud that hangs over the family, yet no one completely addresses it directly. The Von Erich curse seemed to be a real thing. And as a youngster, I always waited for the next Von Erich to die a weird death. Grim as it may seem.The brothers wake up and eat, drink and breathe wrestling. But there is a hierarchy. Broken down by the Fritz. The brothers are meant to compete with each other for the approval of Dad.There is also David (Harris Dickinson) and Kerry (Jeremy Allan White) but not mentioned...a brother Chris. I only knew Kerry, since he made it to the WWF.This at-the-fringe federation of wrestlers were in the NWA, which I always considered the low-rent of wrestling, as if there were such a thing.Kevin marries Pam (Lily James) who is really the most normal of the gang. The mother. Doris (Maura Tierney) seems to be just trying to placate Fritz but also focus on God.I truly miss this type of filmmaking. It is a story of family and tragedy and how they cope with it. Which sometimes I wish they showed more of that and less of the wrestling. This movie's emotional core stuck with me. Though, there are moments that drag, when you think about how awful events followed this family, you are left wondering how they were able to move forward.The answer isn't very clear. These are the moments I wish focused more on Kevin's resilience. Instead, we see he truly believes the family curse. And that would be enough. Perhaps the emotionally absent mother answers the question of pain and loss. There is a great moment when all the death occurs, Mom doesn't know how to cope. Because of her faith, you read the thought bubble which is asking God ""why am I being tested"" a brilliant move by director Sean Durkin NOT to have her say this outloud.One thing that may trouble some viewers is the Fritz's dialogue. At first, I considered it horrible acting. Then it occurred to me. He has been a showboat to audiences most his life. It isn't too far of a stretch that he knows no other way to communicate. He is a tough guy who relies on his sons to be equally as tough. Though he isn't that way at first, he downshifts into it with the success of the family.There's so much to unpack here.Mass kudos to Zac Efron. A brilliant piece of acting which should get him an Oscar nom (perhaps the Academy will never take him seriously...they should). In spite of his stoic mannerisms, Efron still exudes thought processes. In this case, tough guys aren't suppose to cry. But we cry for him.Wonderful work. This is a must to see in theaters. A small screen will not show the subtle performances.","23 December 2023","8/10",NA
"The Iron Claw (2023)","Heartbreaking Cursed Family","statuskuo","The Iron Claw is incredible yet devastating. It's an emotionally haunting film that is going to stick with me for a while. The film delves into the tragic story of the Von Erich family with the utmost reverence, and while I know next to nothing about wrestling, this movie destroyed me. It's a heavy watch that might be the most moving, profound, and honest depiction of family on film this year. Sean Durkin takes an unfathomably tragic story and tells it with needed grace. Zac Efron gives an absolutely touching and heartbreaking performance as Kevin Von Erich. He delivers his most physically and emotionally demanding performance to date, supported by a flawless cast ensemble as they, along with director Sean Durkin, commit to some of the best depictions of wrestling ever seen on film. The Iron Claw is gut-wrenching and beautiful all at the same time, telling a tragic story of brotherhood, love, pain, expectations, favouritism, and legacy. I found myself heartbroken by the tragedies portrayed on screen, yet incredibly moved by the brotherhood these characters shared. Hold your loved ones close!","29 December 2023","8/10",NA

"Land of Bad (2024)","Honestly not bad","ksgillihan","This film isn't going to win any Oscars or be nominated by any stretch of the imagination but it's a solid action flick. It's an interesting take on a military action movie where the drone operator (Crowe) can be the difference between life and death for an American team behind enemy lines. Of course some Hollywood magic carries the movie through scenes that wouldn't otherwise happen in real life but that's to be expected.Crowe does a great job as an aging drone operator who should be higher in rank by now but is held back by his own stubbornness. Without Crowe in this role I think the movie would fall far under the radar (pun intended) of most people looking for a decent action movie to watch. Hemsworth does a decent job in his role but it's Crowe that holds the film together. Worth a watch.","18 February 2024","6/10",NA
"Land of Bad (2024)","Modern look at classic action flicks","eJay17","This movie is a kind of a blast from the past, when action movies like ""Commando"" or ""Missing in Action"" ruled the VHS rental stores. It has absolutely everything that fans of adult cinema appreciate and value - shootouts, swear words in the dialogues, simple motivations and quite good execution.Liam Hemsworth may not be the king of acting, but he delivers a sufficiently interesting role to follow his fate with excitement on face. For me, it was a pleasant screening, although it lacks some clear and positive argument. It is a solid action movie in a modern edition, but without unnecessary corporate influences. It is worth watching, because such productions are basically not produced today.","22 February 2024","7/10",NA
"Land of Bad (2024)","I'm the cavalry","martingreen-71835","A surprisingly entertaining and enjoyable movie based on modern warfare.I'm not usually a fan of war movies, but with a cast including Liam Hemsworth and Russell Crowe I gave it a chance, and I am glad I did.It's your typical good guys vs bad guys movie, with the obligatory fighting, bombs and action which in general work quite well.However this movie relies heavily on modern warfare tactics, with drones, eye in the sky, and missiles which adds something a little different.The acting is quite good, and although some of the characters are somewhat stereotypical and lack imagination, but not enough to spoil the movie.The plot is a little over the top, unrealistic, has a few unlikely turns, but its an action movie at heart, and this allows the writers free reign over the plot.It's never going to compete with the likes of Saving Private Ryan, but was likely never intended to do so.It's a fun movie watch, that doesn't challenge the viewer too much.!","18 February 2024","7/10",NA

Not the best I've ever seen but purely entertaining for what it was. Liam Hemsworth is starting to look more like his brother Chris in his old age. Possibly the one disadvantage to the film because you look at Liam and you think Chris in those Extraction movies but this movie is not on that level.Russel Crowe was amazing in this film. He did so much with so little. It was a part that felt like anyone could play but Crowe put on the acting muscles for this. I see why he's won an Oscar. He's not going to win one for this but he gave a charming performance that made the non-action parts more interesting

The enemies cannot aim if their lives depended on it (which it actually does, making it even more surprising that they cannot aim) and hand grenades has huge explosions, tearing down walls and stuff. But overall fairly realistic, still.So yeah, I would give it a 6.5. Absolutely not a 7 and since 6.5 does not exist I am forced to give it a 6.","16 February 2024","7/10",NA
"Land of Bad (2024)","It is actually quite ok","Movie_Reviews","The Land of Bad follows a.special ops rescue mission to its conclusion. The tone and feel of the movie is reminiscent of Sicario and Top Gun: Maverick. The story is good with some unexpected twists, thrills, and lessons.All of the actors do a great job but Russell Crowe steals the screen through the character 'Reaper,' a civilian contractor working as a drone operator. Reaper cares deeply about his job and takes the mission seriously. The team in the field is his number one priority and that's what makes Reaper so darn likable.All in all the action looked and felt great but that's not what makes Land of Bad a good movie. In fact, I wouldn't even call Land of Bad an action flick. At its heart, Land of Bad is drama about the difficulties surrounding modern combat and its effect on our psyche.Don't get me wrong. It's not an Oscar winner or anything but it's a serious and entertaining movie that I enjoyed enough to write this review.","18 February 2024","6/10",NA
"Land of Bad (2024)","Russell Crowe is incredible","crbrown25","I don't review many movies but I felt obligated when I saw how poorly this is doing in the box office. It's unfair for how well this movie does while watching it.When I first saw this film on a list of movies to watch on a...non reputable website for movies...I thought it was a Netflix or Amazon flick because I've never heard of it before, let alone seen a trailer. Here I come to find out that this movie was not only released in theaters but it was released TWO DAYS AGO (2/15). The marketing team completely dropped the ball on this movie. The major reason that I believe it failed is because there was zero reaching out to potential audiences.This movie has your basic covert jungle style warfare with enemies who can't aim but it kept me entertained and into it the entire time. The acting is decent, and Russell Crowe is great as an 'in your ear drone operator'. The way they used technical equipment in this movie is better than I've seen of late in any modern movie with drone warfare.If you want to see a jungle shooting movie with American good guys shooting at random bad guys then this movie is for you. It's very entertaining and I felt into it the entire time.7/10.","18 February 2024","8/10",NA

"Land of Bad (2024)","I unsuccessfully tried to suspend my disbelief","utterbolx","Someone should have warned them 'Land of Bad' is a marketing disaster as a title for a movie. There is no way I'm going to remember the movie by this title.'Land of Bad' offers nothing original. We've seen this premise so many times before and chances are you're going to watch it for the action and not so much the story. A Delta Force team is sent to the Philippines to extract a CIA agent (whom we never get to see). Kinney (Liam Hemsworth) - also known as Playboy - is mistakenly assigned to the operation, and - as predicted - becomes the protagonist.When the extraction goes horribly wrong, the team relies on drone operator 'Reaper' (Russell Crowe) to be their eyes and guide them to safety. 'Land of Bad' is a no-holds-barred actioner with action and adventure from beginning to end. There are a few very good action sequences and even well crafted suspense. I do think the film's final moments could have been better, but in general I rather enjoyed 'Land of Bad' - even if just for the action and to see those ripped bodies in action.","20 February 2024","3/10",NA
"Land of Bad (2024)","Honestly not bad","ksgillihan","This film isn't going to win any Oscars or be nominated by any stretch of the imagination but it's a solid action flick. It's an interesting take on a military action movie where the drone operator (Crowe) can be the difference between life and death for an American team behind enemy lines. Of course some Hollywood magic carries the movie through scenes that wouldn't otherwise happen in real life but that's to be expected.Crowe does a great job as an aging drone operator who should be higher in rank by now but is held back by his own stubbornness. Without Crowe in this role I think the movie would fall far under the radar (pun intended) of most people looking for a decent action movie to watch. Hemsworth does a decent job in his role but it's Crowe that holds the film together. Worth a watch.","18 February 2024","6/10",NA
"Land of Bad (2024)","Modern look at classic action flicks","eJay17","This movie is a kind of a blast from the past, when action movies like ""Commando"" or ""Missing in Action"" ruled the VHS rental stores. It has absolutely everything that fans of adult cinema appreciate and value - shootouts, swear words in the dialogues, simple motivations and quite good execution.Liam Hemsworth may not be the king of acting, but he delivers a sufficiently interesting role to follow his fate with excitement on face. For me, it was a pleasant screening, although it lacks some clear and positive argument. It is a solid action movie in a modern edition, but without unnecessary corporate influences.

"Land of Bad (2024)","I'm the cavalry","martingreen-71835","A surprisingly entertaining and enjoyable movie based on modern warfare.I'm not usually a fan of war movies, but with a cast including Liam Hemsworth and Russell Crowe I gave it a chance, and I am glad I did.It's your typical good guys vs bad guys movie, with the obligatory fighting, bombs and action which in general work quite well.However this movie relies heavily on modern warfare tactics, with drones, eye in the sky, and missiles which adds something a little different.The acting is quite good, and although some of the characters are somewhat stereotypical and lack imagination, but not enough to spoil the movie.The plot is a little over the top, unrealistic, has a few unlikely turns, but its an action movie at heart, and this allows the writers free reign over the plot.It's never going to compete with the likes of Saving Private Ryan, but was likely never intended to do so.It's a fun movie watch, that doesn't challenge the viewer too much.!","18 February 2024","7/10",NA

Not the best I've ever seen but purely entertaining for what it was. Liam Hemsworth is starting to look more like his brother Chris in his old age.

He's not going to win one for this but he gave a charming performance that made the non-action parts more interesting

The enemies cannot aim if their lives depended on it (which it actually does, making it even more surprising that they cannot aim) and hand grenades has huge explosions, tearing down walls and stuff.

"Land of Bad (2024)","It is actually quite ok","Movie_Reviews","The Land of Bad follows a.special ops rescue mission to its conclusion. The tone and feel of the movie is reminiscent of Sicario and Top Gun: Maverick. The story is good with some unexpected twists, thrills, and lessons.All of the actors do a great job but Russell Crowe steals the screen through the character 'Reaper,' a civilian contractor working as a drone operator. Reaper cares deeply about his job and takes the mission seriously. The team in the field is his number one priority and that's what makes Reaper so darn likable.All in all the action looked and felt great but that's not what makes Land of Bad a good movie. In fact, I wouldn't even call Land of Bad an action flick. At its heart, Land of Bad is drama about the difficulties surrounding modern combat and its effect on our psyche.Don't get me wrong.

Here I come to find out that this movie was not only released in theaters but it was released TWO DAYS AGO (2/15). The marketing team completely dropped the ball on this movie.

Without Crowe in this role I think the movie would fall far under the radar (pun intended) of most people looking for a decent action movie to watch. Hemsworth does a decent job in his role but it's Crowe that holds the film together. Worth a watch.","18 February 2024","6/10",NA
"Land of Bad (2024)","Modern look at classic action flicks","eJay17","This movie is a kind of a blast from the past, when action movies like ""Commando"" or ""Missing in Action"" ruled the VHS rental stores. It has absolutely everything that fans of adult cinema appreciate and value - shootouts, swear words in the dialogues, simple motivations and quite good execution.Liam Hemsworth may not be the king of acting, but he delivers a sufficiently interesting role to follow his fate with excitement on face. For me, it was a pleasant screening, although it lacks some clear and positive argument. It is a solid action movie in a modern edition, but without unnecessary corporate influences. It is worth watching, because such productions are basically not produced today.","22 February 2024","7/10",NA
"Land of Bad (2024)","I'm the cavalry","martingreen-71835","A surprisingly entertaining and enjoyable movie based on modern warfare.I'm not usually a fan of war movies, but with a cast including Liam Hemsworth and Russell Crowe I gave it a chance, and I am glad I did.It's your typical good guys vs bad guys movie, with the obligatory fighting, bombs and action which in general work quite well.However this movie relies heavily on modern warfare tactics, with drones, eye in the sky, and missiles which adds something a little different.The acting is quite good, and although some of the characters are somewhat stereotypical and lack imagination, but not enough to spoil the movie.The plot is a little over the top, unrealistic, has a few unlikely turns, but its an action movie at heart, and this allows the writers free reign over the plot.It's never going to compete with the likes of Saving Private Ryan, but was likely never intended to do so.It's a fun movie watch, that doesn't challenge the viewer too much.!","18 February 2024","7/10",NA
"Land of Bad (2024)","You want action? You got action! Only let down being some silly and totally uncredible plot turns.","imseeg","It seems like the type of movie that will come and go which is too bad because it was decent. Not the best I've ever seen but purely entertaining for what it was. Liam Hemsworth is starting to look more like his brother Chris in his old age. Possibly the one disadvantage to the film because you look at Liam and you think Chris in those Extraction movies but this movie is not on that level.Russel Crowe was amazing in this film. He did so much with so little. It was a part that felt like anyone could play but Crowe put on the acting muscles for this. I see why he's won an Oscar. He's not going to win one for this but he gave a charming performance that made the non-action parts more interesting
Yeah man, truly sorry that this movie seems to be designed to go straight to the streaming services after a courtesy release. Never even heard about it just saw it pop up on my movie theatre app very suddenly when I wanted something to watch.Well worth the time!","17 February 2024","7/10",NA
"Land of Bad (2024)","Enjoyable action movie.","subxerogravity","Not as bad as I feared. There is absolutely no nitty-gritty feel to it. Nothing dark or foreboding. Nothing really suspenseful. No, it floats gently on the surface, fairly nice, controlled and polished. But on the other hand it is mostly fairly realistic and surprisingly gory. The enemies cannot aim if their lives depended on it (which it actually does, making it even more surprising that they cannot aim) and hand grenades has huge explosions, tearing down walls and stuff. But overall fairly realistic, still.So yeah, I would give it a 6.5. Absolutely not a 7 and since 6.5 does not exist I am forced to give it a 6.","16 February 2024","7/10",NA
"Land of Bad (2024)","It is actually quite ok","Movie_Reviews","The Land of Bad follows a.special ops rescue mission to its conclusion. The tone and feel of the movie is reminiscent of Sicario and Top Gun: Maverick. The story is good with some unexpected twists, thrills, and lessons.All of the actors do a great job but Russell Crowe steals the screen through the character 'Reaper,' a civilian contractor working as a drone operator. Reaper cares deeply about his job and takes the mission seriously. The team in the field is his number one priority and that's what makes Reaper so darn likable.All in all the action looked and felt great but that's not what makes Land of Bad a good movie. In fact, I wouldn't even call Land of Bad an action flick. At its heart, Land of Bad is drama about the difficulties surrounding modern combat and its effect on our psyche.Don't get me wrong. It's not an Oscar winner or anything but it's a serious and entertaining movie that I enjoyed enough to write this review.","18 February 2024","6/10",NA
"Land of Bad (2024)","Russell Crowe is incredible","crbrown25","I don't review many movies but I felt obligated when I saw how poorly this is doing in the box office. It's unfair for how well this movie does while watching it.When I first saw this film on a list of movies to watch on a...non reputable website for movies...I thought it was a Netflix or Amazon flick because I've never heard of it before, let alone seen a trailer. Here I come to find out that this movie was not only released in theaters but it was released TWO DAYS AGO (2/15). The marketing team completely dropped the ball on this movie. The major reason that I believe it failed is because there was zero reaching out to potential audiences.This movie has your basic covert jungle style warfare with enemies who can't aim but it kept me entertained and into it the entire time. The acting is decent, and Russell Crowe is great as an 'in your ear drone operator'. The way they used technical equipment in this movie is better than I've seen of late in any modern movie with drone warfare.If you want to see a jungle shooting movie with American good guys shooting at random bad guys then this movie is for you. It's very entertaining and I felt into it the entire time.7/10.","18 February 2024","8/10",NA
"Land of Bad (2024)","The major reason this movie didn't make waves is from ZERO marketing","sgtmattkind","I'm not military, but I have military in my family and I know that never in a million years is the military going to go into a spec-op not knowing whether or not a new member of the team has ever done a halo jump, never mind the actual member hasn't even ever done it on a training mission.Also a drone with IR surveying an LZ, cant see 500 fearless 'militia' with trucks and rocket launchers and trucks and rocket launchers surrounding the LZ that they magically knew where to be at that given time.We've got F18's, Drones, Hellfire missiles raining down everywhere, and the untrained arabs/vietcong/russians just keep running into the line of fire without a care in the world!Not to mention, truck eastbound, mounted patrol westbound, ok I'll just stand in the open chatting to command and then jump in the water at the last minute and not keep moving into the tree line!Dale Dye will be spinning in his grave at the inaccuracies.

"Land of Bad (2024)","Barely ok !!","winak","Ignore the bad reviews. This movie made me sit at the edge of my seat. Been a while since I saw an action movie this good! The camera angles, sound effects and direction is just top notch! It had a lot of stealth elements as well which really catches my attention; felt more like a Splinter Cell Ops military action movie. If you're into stealth, action, and great effects, then this movie is for you. Find some of the reviews here quite hilarious where they state there wasn't enough emotion. This isn't a love movie for Pete's sake! Look at it as an action flick and you'll dig every moment of it! Totally loved it, must watch!","10 March 2024","4/10",NA
"Land of Bad (2024)","I unsuccessfully tried to suspend my disbelief","utterbolx","Someone should have warned them 'Land of Bad' is a marketing disaster as a title for a movie. There is no way I'm going to remember the movie by this title.'Land of Bad' offers nothing original. We've seen this premise so many times before and chances are you're going to watch it for the action and not so much the story. A Delta Force team is sent to the Philippines to extract a CIA agent (whom we never get to see). Kinney (Liam Hemsworth) - also known as Playboy - is mistakenly assigned to the operation, and - as predicted - becomes the protagonist.When the extraction goes horribly wrong, the team relies on drone operator 'Reaper' (Russell Crowe) to be their eyes and guide them to safety. 'Land of Bad' is a no-holds-barred actioner with action and adventure from beginning to end. There are a few very good action sequences and even well crafted suspense. I do think the film's final moments could have been better, but in general I rather enjoyed 'Land of Bad' - even if just for the action and to see those ripped bodies in action.","20 February 2024","3/10",NA

I felt as though the book had come to life here, even if there are a couple of changes.The acting is impressive, as is the music, the visuals however are the most incredible thing about this film, it looks awe inspiring. The battles are epic, the staging is impressive, you almost feel close to the action, I cannot praise that element highly enough.When I saw Part one, I was a little surprised, I was a little more surprised by the ending, I only hope the wait isn't too long.Pacing, considering where the film ends, it never felt slow or drawn out, I was captivated from start to finish.Truly, I was blown away, 10/10.","23 October 2021","9/10",NA
"Dune (2021)","My movie of 2021, so far.","Sleepin_Dragon","You can tell that producers of this movie spent all their budget on visual effects and epic music but they had no money left in the budget to hire someone competent to write a plot for the movie so they ended up filming this.The way the story develops in this movie is very superficial and full of cheap and overdone cliché. Throughout the movie we see more than 50 characters doing things but no one's motivation is ever explained. Bad guys are bad just for the sake of being bad, good guys are good just for the sake of being good. I thought Hollywood stopped doing that stuff in 1970s but I guess this movie still does it in 2021.This movie tries too hard to become ""epic"" without telling its story. The first and foremost job of a movie is to tell a story. Everything else comes second and just supports the goal of delivering a story. In this movie, storytelling is not the first priority, neither second, third or even fourth priority.

If there is a criticism that many share, it is the pacing of the first part of the film. It needed something to set the scene for us, to show us who the strong and the weak were. I'm not much for narration (show me, don't tell me), but it may not have been a bad idea. The scenes are magnificent with special effects off the chart. Many desert travel scenes are quite endless.

"Dune (2021)","Amazing cinematic experience","851222","Although the film is called 'Dune', the opening title refers to it as 'Dune Part One'. I knew, when I saw this, it probably should have been better to wait for Part Two before watching it. As a result some characters felt underdeveloped, and some simply vanished halfway through the movie. They also kept talking about Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) being 'The One', but the one for what? This somehow reminded me of Neo from 'The Matrix', also being 'The One'.Regardless, 'Dune' is a spectacle of note. From the stunning visuals, state of the art CGI, production design, and cinematography, to good performances from a stellar cast and a great score, this is one amazing movie. Sure, the film won't satisfy everyone's palate, and if you're not a sci-fi/fantasy fan, 'Dune' will not appeal to you. However, one can't help but be impressed by what they've accomplished.Ok, now, you can crucify me if you want, but for me there were some issues with the film. With the movie being so long, I later found myself thinking there's a hell of a lot going on, with very little happening. Maybe this is because this is not a completed movie (being Part One), but I didn't always understand the character motives, and I still don't really understand what Paul's real mission is. Spice is the most valuable substance in the universe, and I understand Paul follows in his Father's footsteps to preserve the spice production, but he is always on the move and I don't follow whereto. It sometimes also felt like they were holding back on the action sequences. Some of the action scenes ended so abruptly...Also, large parts of the movie reminded me of other films, like 'Tremors', 'The Chronicles of Riddick', and 'Star Wars'. Then a number of credibility issues. The film is set in 10191, but there were medieval elements here as well. Will they still be using scrolls so far into the future to read messages from? Will they still read books? Will they address leaders as ""My Lord""? This, and their costumes, felt very dated.If the film was about 30 minutes shorter, it would have been much better paced, with all the unnecessary scenes on the cutting room floor. It was just too long to keep me entertained for the entire 155 minutes, no matter how astonishing the production values.Ok, now that I've had my rant, 'Dune' is still an incredibly well made film, and worth watching at least once.","2 August 2023","8/10",NA

Seriously, this thing is GORGEOUS with a capital everything, the sound is spectacular, it's shot beautifully but there just doesn't feel like enough meat beneath all the flash. It is a masterpiece on paper, with performances to match the visuals but after two and a half hours I felt like I was struggling to stay awake through an overlong prologue to an actual story.Yeah, this is going to be multiple movies (assuming they get the green light for another) and it feels like it. Kinda how Fellowship of the Ring felt like a dull venture in walking until the ensuing films added texture to the franchise. Maybe when Dune 2 comes out this one will feel like a more cohesive piece but for now it lacks a soul to match all of the stunning visuals.I'm hitting this one hard when I do think there were some legitimately great things here, it just all felt vacuous and empty and I wanted more of an actual story.

"Dune (2021)","The Beginning","Hitchcoc","Dune (2021): Not at all as retro as Lynch's Dune, the Flash Gordon/Steampunk aesthetic is replaced by starker yet still ancient looking furnishings and the Spaceships are more modern than mondo. Still though, there's something of the Imperial Stormtroopers about some of the soldiers, even those out of armour tend to look like Star Wars ship crews. But this is a far darker tale than any SW chicanery. We see Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet) visiting his grandfathers grave who died fighting a bull, Galician Bagpipes are played as the Atriedes family walk along the exit ramp of a spaceship. The spaceships are impressive, a submerged troop/suppies rising up like a whale. But these ships are are like grains of sand compared to the vast Starships, ornithopters are extensively used for transport and combat on Arrakis. The betrayal and retaking of Arrakis by the Harkonnens is vividly portrayed in attacks from above, hand to hand fighting bombings. Here Duncan Idaho(Jason Momos) is given more room to develop as a character than in the 1984 film, it's yet to be seen if Josh Brolin's Gurney Halleck will match or outdo hat of Patrick Stewart's portrayal. The true role of the Bene Gesserit and the early appreciation by the Fremen of Paul as a potential Prophet/Savior is more subtly related by Villeneuve.

"Dune (2021)","Villeneuve epic","SnoopyStyle","I can't say I'm disappointed with Dune, given the track record of director Denis Villeneuve. In the past, he has stooped to artsy garbage (Enemy), weak adaptations (Arrival, which avoids exactly those elements that made its source an unsettling classic), and hollow spectacle (Blade Runner 2049, an endless, empty, at times ludicrous mess).That said, I didn't hate Dune. I simply found it lackluster.The good: the visuals are splendid. The music is nice, though not exactly memorable. The narrative sticks wisely close to the book.The not so good: first of all, the casting. Not one of the actors in this film really blows me away. Paul Atreides, in particular, is far too weak to hold our attention. Not terrible, but at the same time not capable of suggesting the hidden strength that will soon make him a leader of men, a 'mahdi.' Jessica does a nice job with what she's got, but the script leaves her little to do but whimper, without suggesting the deep well of authority the character should have. The Duke Leto probably fares best, though again I think he's portrayed as a rather weak character, not the iron duke of the book.The worst: the pacing. I didn't find the slow, deliberate pace to be annoying. However, Dune the book is actually both dense and fast-paced. By taking the slow road, Villeneuve leaves no room for the background and character depth that's really needed for a proper epic. Grand vistas are not what make films like Lawrence of Arabia great - it's the deep, powerful storytelling. Even if Villeneuve was allowed to stretch this franchise to three films, it would be too late to fill in the missing detail in this first installment.I hate to think what anyone unfamiliar with Dune, the book, will make of this eye-candy adaptation. Probably, they'll wonder why anyone would bother adapting such a lethargic and superficial book. Dune the movie comes across as a Cliff's Notes version of the book: faithful, yet without any of the juice that make the book so compelling. See it if you have a spare evening, but don't feel there's any urgency about it.","29 October 2021","8/10",NA
"Dune (2021)","Duned from the Start","questl-18592","It's such a shame when brilliant directors like Denis Villeneuve start being given massive budgets to make films and start relying on that rather than good story-telling. The same thing has happened to Christopher Nolan. These guys started their careers turning nothing into pure genius. Now they just seemingly want to go out and spend a $300 million budget and forget that if your story isn't interesting then there is no point.Boy oh boy was this film bland. I was looking at the cast before watching the film. There are certainly some notable names, but I noticed a lot of them are also known for giving very dry performances. There isn't a lot of x-factor amongst them. That's very noticeable in the final product. No performance in the film stands out in any way.To be fair there isn't a lot of interesting things given to them in the script to work with. I was shocked how little character development there was. We are just thrown in and told to side with these people, but no justification is given for it. And because the film is so unrealistic it is impossible to relate in any way to what they're going through.This one wasn't for me. I hadn't exactly been itching to see it, but it was one that I had an outside hope of at least being entertained by. Not the case though sadly. A generous 4/10.","25 October 2021","5/10",NA
"Dune (2021)","Lacks Spice","Fluke_Skywalker","Dune: Part One (2021) is a movie the wife and I saw in theatres at an advanced screening. The storyline tells the tale of an emperor who changes leadership in his most important and profitable planet in his kingdom. Follow the new family as they move in and adjust to a ruthless landscape filled with people who don't want to help them and resources set up for them to fail. They quickly realize they may have bit off more than they can chew on several fronts. This movie is directed by Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049) and stars Timothée Chalamet (Little Women), Rebecca Ferguson (Doctor Sleep), Zendaya (Spider-Man), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker), Jason Mamoa (Aquaman), Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men). The storyline for this is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece in a Star Wars mixed with Game of Thrones kind of way. The vastness and complexity is outstanding and how all the pieces fit together is remarkable. The cast is brilliantly selected and the special effects and action scenes are breathtaking. A few scenes were shot darker than I would have liked but not enough to not call this film perfection. The action scenes are well choreographed and the fierceness of the war and fight sequences were awesome. There is a level of uncertainty in every second of the film. This is a rare masterpiece in a Lord of the Rings/Star Wars kind of way that happens once every 20-30 years that is an absolutely must see.

The narrative sticks wisely close to the book.The not so good: first of all, the casting. Not one of the actors in this film really blows me away. Paul Atreides, in particular, is far too weak to hold our attention. Not terrible, but at the same time not capable of suggesting the hidden strength that will soon make him a leader of men, a 'mahdi.' Jessica does a nice job with what she's got, but the script leaves her little to do but whimper, without suggesting the deep well of authority the character should have. The Duke Leto probably fares best, though again I think he's portrayed as a rather weak character, not the iron duke of the book.The worst: the pacing. I didn't find the slow, deliberate pace to be annoying. However, Dune the book is actually both dense and fast-paced. By taking the slow road, Villeneuve leaves no room for the background and character depth that's really needed for a proper epic. Grand vistas are not what make films like Lawrence of Arabia great - it's the deep, powerful storytelling. Even if Villeneuve was allowed to stretch this franchise to three films, it would be too late to fill in the missing detail in this first installment.I hate to think what anyone unfamiliar with Dune, the book, will make of this eye-candy adaptation. Probably, they'll wonder why anyone would bother adapting such a lethargic and superficial book. Dune the movie comes across as a Cliff's Notes version of the book: faithful, yet without any of the juice that make the book so compelling.

There isn't a lot of x-factor amongst them. That's very noticeable in the final product.

"Dune (2021)","Lacks Spice","Fluke_Skywalker","Dune: Part One (2021) is a movie the wife and I saw in theatres at an advanced screening. The storyline tells the tale of an emperor who changes leadership in his most important and profitable planet in his kingdom. Follow the new family as they move in and adjust to a ruthless landscape filled with people who don't want to help them and resources set up for them to fail. They quickly realize they may have bit off more than they can chew on several fronts. This movie is directed by Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049) and stars Timothée Chalamet (Little Women), Rebecca Ferguson (Doctor Sleep), Zendaya (Spider-Man), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker), Jason Mamoa (Aquaman), Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men). The storyline for this is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece in a Star Wars mixed with Game of Thrones kind of way. The vastness and complexity is outstanding and how all the pieces fit together is remarkable. The cast is brilliantly selected and the special effects and action scenes are breathtaking. A few scenes were shot darker than I would have liked but not enough to not call this film perfection. The action scenes are well choreographed and the fierceness of the war and fight sequences were awesome. There is a level of uncertainty in every second of the film. This is a rare masterpiece in a Lord of the Rings/Star Wars kind of way that happens once every 20-30 years that is an absolutely must see.

I felt as though the book had come to life here, even if there are a couple of changes.The acting is impressive, as is the music, the visuals however are the most incredible thing about this film, it looks awe inspiring. The battles are epic, the staging is impressive, you almost feel close to the action, I cannot praise that element highly enough.When I saw Part one, I was a little surprised, I was a little more surprised by the ending, I only hope the wait isn't too long.Pacing, considering where the film ends, it never felt slow or drawn out, I was captivated from start to finish.Truly, I was blown away, 10/10.","23 October 2021","9/10",NA
"Dune (2021)","My movie of 2021, so far.","Sleepin_Dragon","You can tell that producers of this movie spent all their budget on visual effects and epic music but they had no money left in the budget to hire someone competent to write a plot for the movie so they ended up filming this.The way the story develops in this movie is very superficial and full of cheap and overdone cliché. Throughout the movie we see more than 50 characters doing things but no one's motivation is ever explained. Bad guys are bad just for the sake of being bad, good guys are good just for the sake of being good. I thought Hollywood stopped doing that stuff in 1970s but I guess this movie still does it in 2021.This movie tries too hard to become ""epic"" without telling its story. The first and foremost job of a movie is to tell a story. Everything else comes second and just supports the goal of delivering a story. In this movie, storytelling is not the first priority, neither second, third or even fourth priority. They completely forgot to tell the story while worrying too much about visuals and soundtrack.","22 October 2021","10/10",NA
"Dune (2021)","""He shall know your ways as though born to them.""","classicsoncall","Having read the book a hundred years ago, it took some time to begin to understand what was going on. If there is a criticism that many share, it is the pacing of the first part of the film. It needed something to set the scene for us, to show us who the strong and the weak were. I'm not much for narration (show me, don't tell me), but it may not have been a bad idea. The scenes are magnificent with special effects off the chart. Many desert travel scenes are quite endless. How do you spruce up a desert. I thought the sand worms were a little one dimensional. I know there is another film down the road.","17 September 2021","9/10",NA
"Dune (2021)","Amazing cinematic experience","851222","Although the film is called 'Dune', the opening title refers to it as 'Dune Part One'. I knew, when I saw this, it probably should have been better to wait for Part Two before watching it. As a result some characters felt underdeveloped, and some simply vanished halfway through the movie. They also kept talking about Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) being 'The One', but the one for what? This somehow reminded me of Neo from 'The Matrix', also being 'The One'.Regardless, 'Dune' is a spectacle of note. From the stunning visuals, state of the art CGI, production design, and cinematography, to good performances from a stellar cast and a great score, this is one amazing movie. Sure, the film won't satisfy everyone's palate, and if you're not a sci-fi/fantasy fan, 'Dune' will not appeal to you. However, one can't help but be impressed by what they've accomplished.Ok, now, you can crucify me if you want, but for me there were some issues with the film. With the movie being so long, I later found myself thinking there's a hell of a lot going on, with very little happening. Maybe this is because this is not a completed movie (being Part One), but I didn't always understand the character motives, and I still don't really understand what Paul's real mission is. Spice is the most valuable substance in the universe, and I understand Paul follows in his Father's footsteps to preserve the spice production, but he is always on the move and I don't follow whereto. It sometimes also felt like they were holding back on the action sequences. Some of the action scenes ended so abruptly...Also, large parts of the movie reminded me of other films, like 'Tremors', 'The Chronicles of Riddick', and 'Star Wars'. Then a number of credibility issues. The film is set in 10191, but there were medieval elements here as well. Will they still be using scrolls so far into the future to read messages from? Will they still read books? Will they address leaders as ""My Lord""? This, and their costumes, felt very dated.If the film was about 30 minutes shorter, it would have been much better paced, with all the unnecessary scenes on the cutting room floor. It was just too long to keep me entertained for the entire 155 minutes, no matter how astonishing the production values.Ok, now that I've had my rant, 'Dune' is still an incredibly well made film, and worth watching at least once.","2 August 2023","8/10",NA

That said...With all due respect to the brilliant Mr. Villeneuve, this felt like a massive superficial film that is a technical marvel but feels so hollow. Seriously, this thing is GORGEOUS with a capital everything, the sound is spectacular, it's shot beautifully but there just doesn't feel like enough meat beneath all the flash. It is a masterpiece on paper, with performances to match the visuals but after two and a half hours I felt like I was struggling to stay awake through an overlong prologue to an actual story.Yeah, this is going to be multiple movies (assuming they get the green light for another) and it feels like it. Kinda how Fellowship of the Ring felt like a dull venture in walking until the ensuing films added texture to the franchise. Maybe when Dune 2 comes out this one will feel like a more cohesive piece but for now it lacks a soul to match all of the stunning visuals.I'm hitting this one hard when I do think there were some legitimately great things here, it just all felt vacuous and empty and I wanted more of an actual story.

"Dune (2021)","The Beginning","Hitchcoc","Dune (2021): Not at all as retro as Lynch's Dune, the Flash Gordon/Steampunk aesthetic is replaced by starker yet still ancient looking furnishings and the Spaceships are more modern than mondo. Still though, there's something of the Imperial Stormtroopers about some of the soldiers, even those out of armour tend to look like Star Wars ship crews. But this is a far darker tale than any SW chicanery. We see Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet) visiting his grandfathers grave who died fighting a bull, Galician Bagpipes are played as the Atriedes family walk along the exit ramp of a spaceship. The spaceships are impressive, a submerged troop/suppies rising up like a whale. But these ships are are like grains of sand compared to the vast Starships, ornithopters are extensively used for transport and combat on Arrakis. The betrayal and retaking of Arrakis by the Harkonnens is vividly portrayed in attacks from above, hand to hand fighting bombings. Here Duncan Idaho(Jason Momos) is given more room to develop as a character than in the 1984 film, it's yet to be seen if Josh Brolin's Gurney Halleck will match or outdo hat of Patrick Stewart's portrayal. The true role of the Bene Gesserit and the early appreciation by the Fremen of Paul as a potential Prophet/Savior is more subtly related by Villeneuve.

"Dune (2021)","DUNE - A Great Modern Sci-Fi","FabledGentleman","It's been amazing being back in cinemas after last year, I have seen some good films, and some shockers, this though, is the first great film of the year for me.The story is somehow easier to follow than in the last adaptation, motives and actions are easier to see and follow. I felt as though the book had come to life here, even if there are a couple of changes.The acting is impressive, as is the music, the visuals however are the most incredible thing about this film, it looks awe inspiring. The battles are epic, the staging is impressive, you almost feel close to the action, I cannot praise that element highly enough.When I saw Part one, I was a little surprised, I was a little more surprised by the ending, I only hope the wait isn't too long.Pacing, considering where the film ends, it never felt slow or drawn out, I was captivated from start to finish.Truly, I was blown away, 10/10.","23 October 2021","9/10",NA
"Dune (2021)","My movie of 2021, so far.","Sleepin_Dragon","You can tell that producers of this movie spent all their budget on visual effects and epic music but they had no money left in the budget to hire someone competent to write a plot for the movie so they ended up filming this.The way the story develops in this movie is very superficial and full of cheap and overdone cliché. Throughout the movie we see more than 50 characters doing things but no one's motivation is ever explained. Bad guys are bad just for the sake of being bad, good guys are good just for the sake of being good. I thought Hollywood stopped doing that stuff in 1970s but I guess this movie still does it in 2021.This movie tries too hard to become ""epic"" without telling its story. The first and foremost job of a movie is to tell a story. Everything else comes second and just supports the goal of delivering a story. In this movie, storytelling is not the first priority, neither second, third or even fourth priority. They completely forgot to tell the story while worrying too much about visuals and soundtrack.","22 October 2021","10/10",NA
"Dune (2021)","""He shall know your ways as though born to them.""","classicsoncall","Having read the book a hundred years ago, it took some time to begin to understand what was going on. If there is a criticism that many share, it is the pacing of the first part of the film. It needed something to set the scene for us, to show us who the strong and the weak were. I'm not much for narration (show me, don't tell me), but it may not have been a bad idea. The scenes are magnificent with special effects off the chart. Many desert travel scenes are quite endless. How do you spruce up a desert. I thought the sand worms were a little one dimensional. I know there is another film down the road.","17 September 2021","9/10",NA
"Dune (2021)","Amazing cinematic experience","851222","Although the film is called 'Dune', the opening title refers to it as 'Dune Part One'. I knew, when I saw this, it probably should have been better to wait for Part Two before watching it. As a result some characters felt underdeveloped, and some simply vanished halfway through the movie. They also kept talking about Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) being 'The One', but the one for what? This somehow reminded me of Neo from 'The Matrix', also being 'The One'.Regardless, 'Dune' is a spectacle of note. From the stunning visuals, state of the art CGI, production design, and cinematography, to good performances from a stellar cast and a great score, this is one amazing movie. Sure, the film won't satisfy everyone's palate, and if you're not a sci-fi/fantasy fan, 'Dune' will not appeal to you. However, one can't help but be impressed by what they've accomplished.Ok, now, you can crucify me if you want, but for me there were some issues with the film. With the movie being so long, I later found myself thinking there's a hell of a lot going on, with very little happening. Maybe this is because this is not a completed movie (being Part One), but I didn't always understand the character motives, and I still don't really understand what Paul's real mission is. Spice is the most valuable substance in the universe, and I understand Paul follows in his Father's footsteps to preserve the spice production, but he is always on the move and I don't follow whereto. It sometimes also felt like they were holding back on the action sequences. Some of the action scenes ended so abruptly...Also, large parts of the movie reminded me of other films, like 'Tremors', 'The Chronicles of Riddick', and 'Star Wars'. Then a number of credibility issues. The film is set in 10191, but there were medieval elements here as well. Will they still be using scrolls so far into the future to read messages from? Will they still read books? Will they address leaders as ""My Lord""? This, and their costumes, felt very dated.If the film was about 30 minutes shorter, it would have been much better paced, with all the unnecessary scenes on the cutting room floor. It was just too long to keep me entertained for the entire 155 minutes, no matter how astonishing the production values.Ok, now that I've had my rant, 'Dune' is still an incredibly well made film, and worth watching at least once.","2 August 2023","8/10",NA
"Dune (2021)","Good visual effects, poor storytelling","interestingstuff","I feel I should start by saying I have minimal context for this film. I've never read the book(s?) and I don't really remember the '84 movie all that well. So I'm going into this fairly fresh and with no real explanations. That said...With all due respect to the brilliant Mr. Villeneuve, this felt like a massive superficial film that is a technical marvel but feels so hollow. Seriously, this thing is GORGEOUS with a capital everything, the sound is spectacular, it's shot beautifully but there just doesn't feel like enough meat beneath all the flash. It is a masterpiece on paper, with performances to match the visuals but after two and a half hours I felt like I was struggling to stay awake through an overlong prologue to an actual story.Yeah, this is going to be multiple movies (assuming they get the green light for another) and it feels like it. Kinda how Fellowship of the Ring felt like a dull venture in walking until the ensuing films added texture to the franchise. Maybe when Dune 2 comes out this one will feel like a more cohesive piece but for now it lacks a soul to match all of the stunning visuals.I'm hitting this one hard when I do think there were some legitimately great things here, it just all felt vacuous and empty and I wanted more of an actual story. Still think it's worth checking out, just for the technical mastery and stunning presentation but... That's about all that's here.","22 October 2021","5/10",NA
"Dune (2021)","The Beginning","Hitchcoc","Dune (2021): Not at all as retro as Lynch's Dune, the Flash Gordon/Steampunk aesthetic is replaced by starker yet still ancient looking furnishings and the Spaceships are more modern than mondo. Still though, there's something of the Imperial Stormtroopers about some of the soldiers, even those out of armour tend to look like Star Wars ship crews. But this is a far darker tale than any SW chicanery. We see Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet) visiting his grandfathers grave who died fighting a bull, Galician Bagpipes are played as the Atriedes family walk along the exit ramp of a spaceship. The spaceships are impressive, a submerged troop/suppies rising up like a whale. But these ships are are like grains of sand compared to the vast Starships, ornithopters are extensively used for transport and combat on Arrakis. The betrayal and retaking of Arrakis by the Harkonnens is vividly portrayed in attacks from above, hand to hand fighting bombings. Here Duncan Idaho(Jason Momos) is given more room to develop as a character than in the 1984 film, it's yet to be seen if Josh Brolin's Gurney Halleck will match or outdo hat of Patrick Stewart's portrayal. The true role of the Bene Gesserit and the early appreciation by the Fremen of Paul as a potential Prophet/Savior is more subtly related by Villeneuve. This is just Part One, i eagerly await the second half. Directed/Co-Written by Denis Villeneuve. 9/10.","26 October 2021","8/10",NA
"Dune (2021)","Started off sensational, but eventually overlong with too much going on for too little happening.","paulclaassen","For the first twenty minutes of this joyless nerdfest, I had absolutely no idea what was going on.

"Dune (2021)","Villeneuve epic","SnoopyStyle","I can't say I'm disappointed with Dune, given the track record of director Denis Villeneuve. In the past, he has stooped to artsy garbage (Enemy), weak adaptations (Arrival, which avoids exactly those elements that made its source an unsettling classic), and hollow spectacle (Blade Runner 2049, an endless, empty, at times ludicrous mess).That said, I didn't hate Dune. I simply found it lackluster.The good: the visuals are splendid. The music is nice, though not exactly memorable. The narrative sticks wisely close to the book.The not so good: first of all, the casting. Not one of the actors in this film really blows me away. Paul Atreides, in particular, is far too weak to hold our attention. Not terrible, but at the same time not capable of suggesting the hidden strength that will soon make him a leader of men, a 'mahdi.' Jessica does a nice job with what she's got, but the script leaves her little to do but whimper, without suggesting the deep well of authority the character should have. The Duke Leto probably fares best, though again I think he's portrayed as a rather weak character, not the iron duke of the book.The worst: the pacing. I didn't find the slow, deliberate pace to be annoying. However, Dune the book is actually both dense and fast-paced. By taking the slow road, Villeneuve leaves no room for the background and character depth that's really needed for a proper epic. Grand vistas are not what make films like Lawrence of Arabia great - it's the deep, powerful storytelling. Even if Villeneuve was allowed to stretch this franchise to three films, it would be too late to fill in the missing detail in this first installment.I hate to think what anyone unfamiliar with Dune, the book, will make of this eye-candy adaptation. Probably, they'll wonder why anyone would bother adapting such a lethargic and superficial book. Dune the movie comes across as a Cliff's Notes version of the book: faithful, yet without any of the juice that make the book so compelling. See it if you have a spare evening, but don't feel there's any urgency about it.","29 October 2021","8/10",NA
"Dune (2021)","Duned from the Start","questl-18592","It's such a shame when brilliant directors like Denis Villeneuve start being given massive budgets to make films and start relying on that rather than good story-telling. The same thing has happened to Christopher Nolan. These guys started their careers turning nothing into pure genius. Now they just seemingly want to go out and spend a $300 million budget and forget that if your story isn't interesting then there is no point.Boy oh boy was this film bland. I was looking at the cast before watching the film. There are certainly some notable names, but I noticed a lot of them are also known for giving very dry performances. There isn't a lot of x-factor amongst them. That's very noticeable in the final product. No performance in the film stands out in any way.To be fair there isn't a lot of interesting things given to them in the script to work with. I was shocked how little character development there was. We are just thrown in and told to side with these people, but no justification is given for it. And because the film is so unrealistic it is impossible to relate in any way to what they're going through.This one wasn't for me. I hadn't exactly been itching to see it, but it was one that I had an outside hope of at least being entertained by. Not the case though sadly. A generous 4/10.","25 October 2021","5/10",NA
"Dune (2021)","Lacks Spice","Fluke_Skywalker","Dune: Part One (2021) is a movie the wife and I saw in theatres at an advanced screening. The storyline tells the tale of an emperor who changes leadership in his most important and profitable planet in his kingdom. Follow the new family as they move in and adjust to a ruthless landscape filled with people who don't want to help them and resources set up for them to fail. They quickly realize they may have bit off more than they can chew on several fronts. This movie is directed by Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049) and stars Timothée Chalamet (Little Women), Rebecca Ferguson (Doctor Sleep), Zendaya (Spider-Man), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker), Jason Mamoa (Aquaman), Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men). The storyline for this is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece in a Star Wars mixed with Game of Thrones kind of way. The vastness and complexity is outstanding and how all the pieces fit together is remarkable. The cast is brilliantly selected and the special effects and action scenes are breathtaking. A few scenes were shot darker than I would have liked but not enough to not call this film perfection. The action scenes are well choreographed and the fierceness of the war and fight sequences were awesome. There is a level of uncertainty in every second of the film. This is a rare masterpiece in a Lord of the Rings/Star Wars kind of way that happens once every 20-30 years that is an absolutely must see.

"Anyone But You (2023)","Average rom-com fare","barbett-1","Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy.

The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes.

After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:

One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men

Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways.

They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"".

"Anyone But You (2023)","Bad Movie","cinemapersonified","Anyone But You is an enjoyably cynical rom com that still has plenty of heartfelt romance at its centre. Just getting one of these theatrically released currently is kind of a miracle and it plays squarely to the genre's strengths. All its beats are predictable in the best way.Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell are on their way to becoming genuine movie stars and this film only further solidifies that. The constant barbs they send each other's way for the majority of the film are really funny and the chemistry they're constantly trying to deny has a real spark to it.This isn't Will Gluck's first rom com and that's apparent in the good ways.

The acting was AWFUL, especially from the lead actress who tried so hard to act seductive but it just came off as terrible. Everything about this movie made no sense. The plot line was awful. It felt like watching a really cheesy Netflix rom-com but a hundred times worse.

I went with my adult children and we all loved the movie. My kids make fun of my love for Hallmark movies, but even they liked this one. We laughed out loud repeatedly and walked out smiling.

They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"".

"Anyone But You (2023)","Average rom-com fare","barbett-1","Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off.

The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes.

They're extraordinary specimens and look like they spend 6 hours a day in the gym, but I also like them as actors. Glen Powell was really good in another enjoyable modern rom-com with Zoey Deutch called ""Set It Up"" and he's fearless here, especially with the over the top body humor.Sydney Sweeney is certainly voluptuous, and gorgeous to look at, but she's also established herself as a great actress in more critic friendly shows like ""Euphoria"" and ""White Lotus"".

"Anyone But You (2023)","Average rom-com fare","barbett-1","Neither brilliant nor dreadful, ""Anyone But You"" features a cast of characters that are unbelievably attractive and, apparently, insanely wealthy. It stars Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeny's breasts in the formulatic equivalent of a Hallmark Movie knock-off. You know the drill - two perfect young people meet, are instantly attracted to each other, are separated by a misunderstanding with hilarious hijinks ensuing. The misunderstanding is eventually resolved, love blooms once more, and all ends well.What sets this film apart is excellent cinematography with lovely wide-angle views of the Australian countryside. The supporting cast is very capable although the Australian men are played as oafish stereotypes. Glen Powell plays his part well, but Sydney Sweeny appears to be reading her lines from a teleprompter offscreen. Not the worst movie out this holiday season and enjoyable as long as you refrain from high expectations.","5 January 2024","5/10",NA
"Anyone But You (2023)","F-grade rom-com with little rom and even less com","pkertes-59666","I went to see this movie because I am a sucker for a romantic comedy, even the average ones (and let's face it, most of them are). Having seen the trailer, I had low expectations, yet this film still managed to come it at an even lower level.Boy meets girl, they hit it off briefly, there is a misunderstanding and when they reconnect through a friend/family wedding, they hate each other. Except as anyone could predict, ultimately they don't really, but it takes an eternity of inauthentic, puerile dross to get there. No tissues needed here.The acting is generally average to poor, and local actors like Rachel Griffiths and Bryan Brown (much of it filmed in Australia) do the minimum required, and are completely wasted here. The script is juvenile, facile and has little in common with reality. The direction is pedestrian and much of the movie is a travel ad for Sydney. Throw in plastic, unlikeable characters and a healthy dose of gratuitous nudity. The attempts at comedy are almost laughable as that, and what little romance eventuates at the end fails to convince after nearly two hours of tripe beforehand.Not recommended, even if you are a fan of the genre.","8 January 2024","4/10",NA
"Anyone But You (2023)","I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.","trinaboice","IN A NUTSHELL:
After an amazing first date, Bea and Ben's fiery attraction turns ice-cold until they find themselves unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding in Australia that their exes also attend. So, they do what any two mature adults would do: pretend to be a couple amidst the fighting.The film was directed by Will Gluck, who also wrote it with Ilana Wolpert.Ultimately, this is like a rated R Hallmark movie with lots of raunch.THINGS I LIKED:
There is plenty of eye candy here for everyone. The cast is filled with good-looking people and includes Sydney Sweeney, Glen Powell, Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, GaTa, Michelle Hurd, Dermot Mulroney, Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown, and more.Sydney Sweeney was bit by a spider in the movie while filming. That famous clip was posted online and got a lot of stir.We get to visit Australia during the film.The cast is diverse, offering a variety of stories about romance and love.The last scene takes clips from the whole movie and has all of the actors sing the same song for a feel-good moment.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Sure, everyone in the cast is hot, but the script is garbage. It sounded like it was written by a trashy version of Chat GPT.It's supposed to be funny, but it's pathetic how they are instantly super ugly and mean-spirited to each other when they have a miscommunication.It's SUPER predictable.Cliched end-of-movie singing, dancing scene.So much fighting.So many awkward moments.They say the movie is loosely based on Shakepeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but I think the Bard would be disgusted by the lack of intelligent language in the script. So many F-bombs. One similarity is that they get a wedding cake from a shop called ""Dogberry's"", which is the name of a character in the play.I cringed and rolled my eyes so many times.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is definitely not appropriate for kids. It portrays unhealthy relationships and extremely bad behavior.Kids will be completely bored because it's mostly adults talking to each other.Profanity and lots of F-bombs
A lesbian couple kisses and gets married
We see a topless woman
We see several shirtless men
A couple gropes each other inside their shorts.Two women wear bikini tops that barely cover anything.We see a ton of cleavage
A lot of sexual innuendo. We see an unmarried couple in the shower and bed together.We see two men smoke a joint.!","31 December 2023","4/10",NA

The bickering is annoying. Sydney Sweeney is a really good actress, I really liked her in The White Lotus, but she's hasn't been in a movie that uses her full potential yet. The movie is full of cliches. It even has the funny black friend with no love life. I'm really shocked by how much money this movie made.

"Poor Things(2023)","Turns out the real poor things were the audience all along.","Pjtaylor-96-138044","While I am loathe to criticise a fairly original story and something quite different from the norm, this film was definitely not for me. I'm a big fan of Stone, Ruffalo and Defoe so it pains me even more to be negative but I did not like this at all and feel tricked by the high review scores, to the point where I feel the need to leave a low score to balance it out a bit.I was left thinking suddenly I no longer understand film for this to have scored so high.I'm not sure why this is deemed a comedy, it is much more a horror in the conventional sense. Frequently grotesque and music designed to make you want to hit the mute button. I tried to like the style and cinematography but I just found the whole story so unpleasant as to be completely distracting.The one thing I did find funny was the first frame saying 'CONTAINS TOBACCO REFERENCES', which is then proceeded by the opening shot of a suicide.

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good then? There are lots of goodies! This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls into the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's honestly masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky acting performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time. More trivial human ""experiences"" like Emma Stone discovering what ""eating"" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be some character I can really relate to or sympathize with. And in this absurd story there simply is NOBODY...Because of the ABSURDITY of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me COLD, but as I said before, a small group of the arthouse movie fans will love it to pieces, but I guess that MANY more casual movie goers will probably be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it... like I was as well...Despite my mixed feelings about this movie, thank you for reading my 2200 th review on Imdb!","6 January 2024","3/10",NA
"Poor Things(2023)","The Weirdest Masterpiece I've Seen in Many Years","kjproulx","Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.","12 March 2024","10/10",NA

I like a movie that has depth and this one did not. The director wanted to make something original. It is original (to an extent) but not appealing.

Everything is poorly developed, from the beginning to the end. There is no intrigue, not even in the end, which would have gave for a lot. The entire film is a spectacle of fireworks that are nothing more than that in order to try to entertain the eye as much as possible in about two and a half hours that seemed eternal, and where I managed to contemplate a worthy escape from the movie theater by first time in my life. I feel sorry for actors like Mr. Dafoe who, although he is spectacular as always, I highly doubt that this film has served him as anything more than making money. I feel sorry for Miss Stone for exposing herself and her skin this way for a movie that isn't worth it. I must be honest in saying that when the movie ended and the credits rolled I paid attention to a beautiful soundtrack as I got up from my seat exhausted.Sorry, but this film reminds me of these people in instagram making tiny sounds with old film cameras that nowbody uses anymore and in a truly nostalgic well recorded process that ends in a photography that do not work for nothing.","24 December 2023","2/10",NA
"Poor Things(2023)","A Bizarre Masterpiece","aciessi","Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.","20 January 2024","9/10",NA

Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange.

"Poor Things(2023)","A Bizarre Masterpiece","aciessi","Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly.

"Poor Things(2023)","A Bizarre Masterpiece","aciessi","Bella Baxter is a woman with the mind of a child- literally. The product of a Frankensteinesque experiment by eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, Bella has spent all her life locked in his mansion, surrounded by his other creations. After Godwin hires medical student Max McCandles to be his assistant, Bella begins to develop, her intelligence increasing rapidly. Craving autonomy and wanting to see the world, Bella decides to travel with Godwin's slick lawyer Duncan Wedderburn, although life outside the mansion proves to be strange and harsh; and Duncan's charm only skin deep.A stylish, off-beat comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' is a witty, original and compelling tale told with verve and panache. Based on the novel of the same name by Alasdair Gray, the film- a fresh approach to the Frankenstein story- is full of Lanthimos's trademark satirical black humour. Examining the nature of identity and exposing the dark, hypocritical heart of Victorian society, Tony McNamara's screenplay works on multiple levels, and his dialogue is consistently hilarious.Culturally relevant, the picture offers a surreal portrait of a woman trying to escape a patriarchal system, embarking on a journey of self-discovery. Bella's awakening- both psychologically and sexually- is a fascinating, funny exploration of agency, desire and identity, as she encounters people and scenarios that challenge her worldview and sense of self. Never pretentious or overly intellectual, the movie is packed with interesting ideas and dark comedy, both gripping and entertaining.Much like 'The Lobster' or 'The Favourite', the movie has a striking visual style, although differs from Lanthimos's previous efforts, which relied on naturalistic settings and minimalistic cinematography. The world he has created is bizarre and evocative, harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood through the implementation of sound stages and painted backgrounds. At times, cinematographer Robbie Ryan employs a 16mm, fisheye lens, which distorts perspectives, fostering a sense of disorientation and wonder. He creates a dreamlike atmosphere, while his subtle utilisation of zooms and tracking shots intensifies the astounding artificiality of proceedings.Shona Heath and James Price's production design is intricate and artistic, compounding the absurd inventiveness of the narrative. Furthermore, Zsuzsa Mihalek's set decoration is highly detailed, adding layers of texture and personality to locations. From the eclectic collection of stuffed animals in Godwin's home, to the lavish, decadent costumes and props, Heath, Price and Mihalek's work creates a rich, immersive visual experience. Their work also contributes to the themes at play, creating contrast between the natural and the artificial; the humorous and tragic, which Holly Waddington's striking costume design only compounds.The first film where Lanthimos has utilised an original score, Jerskin Fendrix's music complements the narrative perfectly. Unique and reminiscent of the work of Dutch composer Ernst Reijseger, Fendrix's eerie, emotionally charged melodies make Bella's journey all the more affecting, heightening the humour and drama therein. In addition, Yorgos Mavropsaridis's smooth editing gives the film a consistent pace, adding to its suspense and momentum.Emma Stone stars as Bella, opposite Willem Dafoe as Godwin, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan and Ramy Youssef as Max. Arguably, Stone has never delivered a performance so intense and nuanced. She displays Bella's evolution astutely, totally disappearing inside the character. Handling the physicality of the role masterfully, she is never anything other than believable. One can imagine lesser actresses hamming it up as Bella: Stone delivers a tour-de-force performance, both captivating and compelling.As the seedy, pathetic Duncan, Ruffalo does marvellous work. He is hilariously over-the-top, sharing a great chemistry with Stone. Their scenes together- particularly after they board a cruise ship- are hilarious, thanks to their great working relationship- and McNamara's excellent dialogue. Dafoe is, as always, terrific. He imbues Godwin with a subtle blend of madness, genius and compassion, making the audience both sympathize with, and question, his motives. Youssef also does commendable work as Max, bringing an understated calmness and sincerity to the role.A wildly entertaining black comedy, Yorgos Lanthimos's 'Poor Things' fires on all cylinders. Boasting a strong screenplay from Tony McNamara that deals with themes- such as patriarchy and identity- with verve and style, great, witty dialogue and a stirring score, it impresses on every level. Visually stunning, and featuring a commanding, compelling performance from Emma Stone- as well as impressive work from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo- 'Poor Things' is rich entertainment.","20 January 2024","9/10",NA

"Madame Web(2024)","Makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight","MovieWarfare","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","15 February 2024","1/10",NA
"Madame Web(2024)","How are bad writers able to continually get hired for big budget films?","syntory","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story.

Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring.

But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on.

I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark.

"Madame Web(2024)","Movie featuring Pepsi & product placement","hotrobinproductions","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","14 February 2024","1/10",NA
"Madame Web(2024)","Sony needs to stop making superhero content","tbunker-88294","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","16 February 2024","1/10",NA

"Madame Web(2024)","A massive waste of time","ethanbresnett","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","15 February 2024","3/10",NA
"Madame Web(2024)","I regret watching this film","sinscopefilms","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago.","20 February 2024","3/10",NA
"Madame Web(2024)","Makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight","MovieWarfare","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written?

Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories.

But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything.

"Madame Web(2024)","Movie featuring Pepsi & product placement","hotrobinproductions","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","14 February 2024","1/10",NA

The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow.

I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling.

I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film.

"Madame Web(2024)","A massive waste of time","ethanbresnett","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","15 February 2024","3/10",NA

The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way.

"Madame Web(2024)","A massive waste of time","ethanbresnett","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series.","15 February 2024","3/10",NA
"Madame Web(2024)","I regret watching this film","sinscopefilms","It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget.

"Madame Web(2024)","Makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight","MovieWarfare","Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!","15 February 2024","1/10",NA
"Madame Web(2024)","How are bad writers able to continually get hired for big budget films?","syntory","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it.","17 February 2024","2/10",NA
"Madame Web(2024)","I had a bad feeling about this one, going in...","AlsExGal","Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad.","14 February 2024","2/10",NA
"Madame Web(2024)","A gigantic mess","chenp-54708","Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10.","14 February 2024","1/10",NA

"Madame Web(2024)","Movie featuring Pepsi & product placement","hotrobinproductions","Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time.","14 February 2024","1/10",NA
"Madame Web(2024)","Sony needs to stop making superhero content","tbunker-88294","First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10.","16 February 2024","1/10",NA

It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this.

Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions.

I thought the third act of the movie felt a little stretched out but otherwise I think it's the best movie I've seen all year because I haven't laughed this much in any recent one. From the short time I spent in China, it's also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents 'cause they really do be like that. I can't recommend it enough, it's so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it's unique on it's own and I'm glad it was released earlier so that people don't compare them.

If only we could accept our kids for who they are, and say supportive things from the heart instead of trying to mold them. If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we've got.Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel's character was a nice touch.The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it's all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on.

" Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","The most original film ever made. Period.","benjaminskylerhill","Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime.

It contains impressive action, drama, SF, humor as well as numerous incredible scenes and shots. I give him a big plus for his incredible originality and idea. However, for me personally, the film was a little too much, to put it that way. In the context of the Oscars, it's also incredible to me that the film picked up so many important awards.

" Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","This movie truly speaks for me","justdan2023","It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.","18 November 2023","10/10",NA

" Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","It Seemed Endless","Hitchcoc","Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.The story is of, Evelyn, a woman who has never really committed to much in life. She has many interest but many where she isn't fully invested in. In this case, her family lives above the laundromat that is failing. They are being audited, but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise. Her husband (the fore mentioned Ke Huy Quan) Waymond, is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good. Pessimist, if we are to be formal. It is the Chinese New Year, and many people are invited to celebrate with this family, including a Grand-Father who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldn't understand the same-sex relationship of his grandaughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). What follows is a grand adventure, first at the IRS building (of all places) and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didn't take place. I absolutely loved the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis plays the uptight auditor, who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around. Evelyn, on the other hand, taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane life.Yes, there is a message here. And...to be honest, it nearly derails the film itself. But it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on. That we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there (if you believe in metaphysics) and that they road you didn't take, through gained experiences, with some that even was more enticing then the present one, means we would never have known our other lives. Children wouldn't be born, love would be lost, relationships move on. It is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didn't take, would it all mean anything. In this case, I say it almost derails because the universes effect one another. And in this story, it even bridges them. Which to some, may feel like a cheat. However, the fact that I even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story. That is for you to decide.The movie is exciting, vibrant, energetic and feels absolutely unique. It allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together, and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead. But doesn't let you lose yourself too much. What it isn't is boring. It is captivating and fresh. And, look, who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phalluses?That said, it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future. Because it deserves a bigger audience. These are the types of fun, philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need.I go back to Ke Huy Quan. This guy can do funny and also bring a tug to your heart so easily. It's so hard to imagine him as the little boy from ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom"" because, here he shows so much range. His natural charm is shown through his love for Evelyn. He seems to be suffering through a fracture himself. He plays many roles here as well. Because, in many universes in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. That's a very romanticized view on the universe.Kudos to The Daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. It would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. Perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.Thank you for this movie.","25 June 2022","6/10",NA

" Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","The most original film ever made. Period.","benjaminskylerhill","Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We're only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!","25 March 2022","10/10",NA

Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We're only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!","25 March 2022","10/10",NA
" Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","The best acid trip experience that can only be felt once in a lifetime!","iamianiman","Ok, the movie contains a lot, a lot. It contains impressive action, drama, SF, humor as well as numerous incredible scenes and shots. I give him a big plus for his incredible originality and idea. However, for me personally, the film was a little too much, to put it that way. In the context of the Oscars, it's also incredible to me that the film picked up so many important awards. Is this the best movie of the year?! Reading numerous reviews and comments, it's clear to me that I'm in the minority and that's why I'm surprised by all the hype surrounding the film.

" Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","This movie truly speaks for me","justdan2023","It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.","18 November 2023","10/10",NA

I reached a point about two-thirds through this where I couldn't get my mind back in it. Have we reached a point where we have no expectations of a conclusion. When one has someone playing multiple characters in multiple settings, there needs to be something tying it together. The protagonist needs to be someone we identify with who has wishes and hopes that lead us on. She seemed as confused as the storyteller and the husband. I guess I'll read some more about this film and hope with guidance to try to figure it out a bit. Obviously, all these universes and all this actions (way too much battling in my estimation) are leading somewhere. I thought the film had ended about six times. I don't mind being brought back in, but I wish I understood where we just landed. Yes, there is a lot going on and it is violently splashed on the screen.

" Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","It Seemed Endless","Hitchcoc","Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.The story is of, Evelyn, a woman who has never really committed to much in life. She has many interest but many where she isn't fully invested in. In this case, her family lives above the laundromat that is failing. They are being audited, but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise. Her husband (the fore mentioned Ke Huy Quan) Waymond, is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good. Pessimist, if we are to be formal. It is the Chinese New Year, and many people are invited to celebrate with this family, including a Grand-Father who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldn't understand the same-sex relationship of his grandaughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). What follows is a grand adventure, first at the IRS building (of all places) and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didn't take place. I absolutely loved the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis plays the uptight auditor, who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around. Evelyn, on the other hand, taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane life.Yes, there is a message here. And...to be honest, it nearly derails the film itself. But it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on. That we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there (if you believe in metaphysics) and that they road you didn't take, through gained experiences, with some that even was more enticing then the present one, means we would never have known our other lives. Children wouldn't be born, love would be lost, relationships move on. It is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didn't take, would it all mean anything. In this case, I say it almost derails because the universes effect one another. And in this story, it even bridges them. Which to some, may feel like a cheat. However, the fact that I even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story. That is for you to decide.The movie is exciting, vibrant, energetic and feels absolutely unique. It allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together, and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead. But doesn't let you lose yourself too much. What it isn't is boring. It is captivating and fresh. And, look, who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phalluses?That said, it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future. Because it deserves a bigger audience. These are the types of fun, philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need.I go back to Ke Huy Quan. This guy can do funny and also bring a tug to your heart so easily. It's so hard to imagine him as the little boy from ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom"" because, here he shows so much range. His natural charm is shown through his love for Evelyn. He seems to be suffering through a fracture himself. He plays many roles here as well. Because, in many universes in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. That's a very romanticized view on the universe.Kudos to The Daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. It would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. Perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.Thank you for this movie.","25 June 2022","6/10",NA

I thought the third act of the movie felt a little stretched out but otherwise I think it's the best movie I've seen all year because I haven't laughed this much in any recent one. From the short time I spent in China, it's also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents 'cause they really do be like that. I can't recommend it enough, it's so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it's unique on it's own and I'm glad it was released earlier so that people don't compare them.

" Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","Fantastic","gbill-74877","""Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on.""If only we could recognize that those who combat us in life do so out of hidden pain, and fight them with kindness. If only we could accept our kids for who they are, and say supportive things from the heart instead of trying to mold them. If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we've got.Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel's character was a nice touch.The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it's all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on. It's one that rewards a rewatch to, as its full of little details and references. Just a great film, lots of fun, and from the heart.","31 March 2022","10/10",NA
" Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","The most original film ever made. Period.","benjaminskylerhill","Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time.

If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we've got.Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel's character was a nice touch.The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it's all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on. It's one that rewards a rewatch to, as its full of little details and references. Just a great film, lots of fun, and from the heart.","31 March 2022","10/10",NA
" Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","The most original film ever made. Period.","benjaminskylerhill","Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We're only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!","25 March 2022","10/10",NA
" Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","The best acid trip experience that can only be felt once in a lifetime!","iamianiman","Ok, the movie contains a lot, a lot. It contains impressive action, drama, SF, humor as well as numerous incredible scenes and shots. I give him a big plus for his incredible originality and idea. However, for me personally, the film was a little too much, to put it that way. In the context of the Oscars, it's also incredible to me that the film picked up so many important awards. Is this the best movie of the year?! Reading numerous reviews and comments, it's clear to me that I'm in the minority and that's why I'm surprised by all the hype surrounding the film. For some, this is even one of the best films ever made. Due to these expectations, I have to admit that the film did not impress me at all. It's not a problem for me to admit that it's up to me and that I can't understand the magnitude of the film, which will obviously be a cult classic tomorrow. But I am surprised that such a strange film won over so many people.","1 March 2024","9/10",NA
" Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","This movie truly speaks for me","justdan2023","It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.","18 November 2023","10/10",NA
" Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","This is the best movie of the year?!","ivanmessimilos","There's a point here where we are swept up in sensory overload, where so much stuff is thrown at us that we tune it out. I reached a point about two-thirds through this where I couldn't get my mind back in it. Have we reached a point where we have no expectations of a conclusion. When one has someone playing multiple characters in multiple settings, there needs to be something tying it together. The protagonist needs to be someone we identify with who has wishes and hopes that lead us on. She seemed as confused as the storyteller and the husband. I guess I'll read some more about this film and hope with guidance to try to figure it out a bit. Obviously, all these universes and all this actions (way too much battling in my estimation) are leading somewhere. I thought the film had ended about six times. I don't mind being brought back in, but I wish I understood where we just landed. Yes, there is a lot going on and it is violently splashed on the screen. But I ended up exhausted and unsatisfied.","26 March 2022","6/10",NA
" Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","What a perfect title for this movie.","subxerogravity","I don't mind weird films. Truly, I don't. But films that are pointlessly bizarre? Yeah, I'm not a fan of those. This is one such movie. I'd give it a pass if I were you.","3 April 2023","9/10",NA
" Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","It Seemed Endless","Hitchcoc","Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.The story is of, Evelyn, a woman who has never really committed to much in life. She has many interest but many where she isn't fully invested in. In this case, her family lives above the laundromat that is failing. They are being audited, but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise. Her husband (the fore mentioned Ke Huy Quan) Waymond, is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good. Pessimist, if we are to be formal. It is the Chinese New Year, and many people are invited to celebrate with this family, including a Grand-Father who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldn't understand the same-sex relationship of his grandaughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). What follows is a grand adventure, first at the IRS building (of all places) and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didn't take place. I absolutely loved the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis plays the uptight auditor, who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around. Evelyn, on the other hand, taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane life.Yes, there is a message here. And...to be honest, it nearly derails the film itself. But it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on. That we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there (if you believe in metaphysics) and that they road you didn't take, through gained experiences, with some that even was more enticing then the present one, means we would never have known our other lives. Children wouldn't be born, love would be lost, relationships move on. It is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didn't take, would it all mean anything. In this case, I say it almost derails because the universes effect one another. And in this story, it even bridges them. Which to some, may feel like a cheat. However, the fact that I even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story. That is for you to decide.The movie is exciting, vibrant, energetic and feels absolutely unique. It allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together, and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead. But doesn't let you lose yourself too much. What it isn't is boring. It is captivating and fresh. And, look, who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phalluses?That said, it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future. Because it deserves a bigger audience. These are the types of fun, philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need.I go back to Ke Huy Quan. This guy can do funny and also bring a tug to your heart so easily. It's so hard to imagine him as the little boy from ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom"" because, here he shows so much range. His natural charm is shown through his love for Evelyn. He seems to be suffering through a fracture himself. He plays many roles here as well. Because, in many universes in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. That's a very romanticized view on the universe.Kudos to The Daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. It would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. Perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.Thank you for this movie.","25 June 2022","6/10",NA
"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","The truly epic blockbuster we needed.","Top_Dawg_Critic","In one of the more memorable lines in the original Top Gun, Maverick gets chewed out by a superior who tells him, ""Son, your ego's writing checks your body can't cash."" Sometimes I wonder if Tom Cruise took that putdown as a personal challenge. No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he's as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he's ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise's regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They're tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, ""Hold My Hand."" It's nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie's ""Take My Breath Away,"" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you're really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that's because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he's trying to show us that there's room for the old and the new to coexist. He's also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions.","26 May 2022","10/10",NA

"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","This is why we go to the movies","dtucker86","What an excellent sequel - I, in fact, like it more than its predecessor.'Top Gun: Maverick' is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.The story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' (unexplained) absence.Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.A great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.","26 May 2022","10/10",NA
"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","Let me just say...","lovefalloutkindagamer","Top Gun (1986) made Tom Cruise a star, and now 36 years later he jumps back in role of Pete Mitchell AKA Maverick almost like he never left.Maverick never seems let his age slow him down, and still is cocky has ever, and is ordered to train a bunch of young pilots for a deadly mission, but sees a little bit of himself in them, and must get them working together has a team.Tom Cruise is great has Maverick, who is coming to terms with the past. Miles Teller and Glen Powell are also great, and not to mention Jennifer Connelly. But the flying scenes are what makes this movie, you feel like your flying with them. Feels has real has ever.

"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","The real cinema experience!","alexglimbergwindh","5 out of 5 stars.Top Gun Maverick is an awesome action film that lives up to the original film and way superior as well. It is one awesome thrill ride that will have the audiences gasping for air with its exhilarating aerial combat scenes.The plot is great. It continues with Maverick (Tom Cruise) being assigned to train new pilots before they go off on a challenging mission. Rooster (Miles Teller) is among the recruits which Maverick tries to reconnect after the incident with his father in the previous film.The plot tries to build an emotional powerhouse as Maverick are neck to neck about the past. And Maverick trying to get these pilots prepared for there first combat.The script is great and fast moving. Director Joseph Kosinski nails making a blockbuster film. Making the action sequences cinematic. And big and loud. Majority of the action scenes are practical and realistic which makes it better. The climatic sequence with the pilots on the mission was awesome and thrilling. Definitely worth seeing this film on the biggest screen with great sound quality.The cast ensemble is great. Tom Cruise nails making a big action film. Cant wait to see what he does with his next films. Miles Teller also was good. Jennifer Connelly playing Mavericks past love interest. The new additions were all great as well. The music score was awesome.The opening sequence gives you the chills with its similiarities to the first.Top Gun Maverick is one of the best films this year. Amazing action sequences that is cinematic and big. And big film that deserves to be seen in theatres.","25 May 2022","10/10",NA
"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","What an excellent sequel","r96sk","See? This is why I LOVE Tom Cruise Post-Mid-1992. Aside from the RARE misfire, cough, cough, The Mummy, when Tom Cruise wants a movie to be better than perfect, he pushes it past Mach 10.The first half of this adventure made me feel this is the perfect and worthy sequel to the original. AND THEN...the second half kicked in thoroughly SURPASSING the original by a landslide. Now, it certainly will not have the impact on the 2020s as the original did for the 1980s - that's lightning that can't be caught twice. But, rest assured: this simultaneously saluted the 1986 classic and then told it to hold its beer.Maverick never changed. And just went he was about to use up his seemingly endless supply of luck, he got recruited back into the ""Top Gun"" division to get the elite ready for a, dare I?, almost Impossible Mission. Oh, and there's a ton of drama and obligatory dick-measuring thrown in.What matters most is: the setup for the film takes place perfectly in the first act giving us clear direction (something the original lacked,) and gave us goals with character building to anticipate and cheer on. When the climax began, it's WAS exactly what I wanted, until it went on another 15 minutes to make the movie SOAR beyond my expectations.While the acting was superb from the Veterans, it wasn't all that great from the fresh new recruits. That was to be expected. Much like their characters in the movie, they're learning to be the best. And they may someday.The movie's music is not as great as the original, but the movie used it sparingly, correctly and with some great new tracks. The original knew it had a killer soundtrack and overdid it. This one showed the restraint it needed.If you loved the first one, there's virtually no way you wouldn't love this even more. It's absolutely perfect for those who were there buying tickets for the original and it's also great for newbies so they can learn to appreciate the classics and understand: with age comes experience and that should never be mocked. It should be learned from and used to progress.And to Top it all off, all of the practical stunts and aerial shots made 10x more sense and easier to follow this time around. I just rewatched the original last night for only the second time (the first being on home video in 2015) and my head was literally spinning to follow the action in the sky. Here, they make sure no one is left in the dust.I can't recommend this movie enough and to see it in theatres, preferably a Dolby-certified one. Don't wait for Paramount+ to pick this up (like I normally would.) Go see this now on the big screen as it should be seen and don't miss out like I did with the original in 1986.***Final Thoughts: I *just* made my Top Ten Tom Cruise movie list, time to update it:1.

"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","Tom Cruise really knows how a blockbuster film is made.","cruise01","It makes more than sense to have seen the first Maverick movie. I am writing this with that in mind. Actually I would even argue that the rating also had something to do with it. Watching it on the big screen also helps a lot of course. My summary line is actually a quote from the movie. Not just the first one, but one that is being said here too. And you will get the full impact of that sentence, of those words, if you know what they mean and why they are said.There are quite a few connections to the first movie, but there is also nods to real life. Especially with Val Kilmer in mind. And all is serving the story - even the real life struggle Kilmer has, that gets woven into the character Iceman. So there are two of the big stars of the first one name checked - what about Kelly McGillis though? Well don't hold your breath (it is being taken away, sorry for the pun)! She is not returning. Now you could be mad at the movie for that - or you could salute it for bringing ""back"" a character that was only name checked in the first movie - and being played by the wonderful Jennifer Connely.Now is she as beautiful as ever? Yes. But she is also close to the age of Tom Cruise that some other names could have been. Of course do not overthink the age thing, because you'd find that her real age would have been inappropriate during the time of the first movie ... just saying. Again: do not overthink it at all.Those things out of the way, we get introduced to a whole bunch of new characters. There probably is not as much ... well male on male energy here as there was in the first one. Even in the dialog - you just feel it. Don't give me that look (and yes I know it is the only one you've got - especially when I bring the puns)! There is more than a coherent story - and the movie takes its time to tell it. There is plenty of action too.There is also technical talk that I didn't totally understand. But it is not necessary to get the movie or enjoy it. And then there is the ending - and what a perfect ending this has. So much so, that I decided it deserves the 10 rating I finally gave it. It may copy many things from the first movie (call it homage), especially the intro but also some story beats, but it still stands ... or rather flies on its own! Just buckle your seatbelt, because you may get dizzy.First time watching I could spot the music cues from the first one, but there were also some fresh elements to it. If I didn't know Lady Gaga was at least partly (big parts if I understood correctly) responsible for the soundtrack, I wouldn't have guessed myself to be honest. As it is, one of the biggest highlights in cinemas this year - the waiting was worth it. If you feel the need .. the need for speed - your need will be satisfied here (or rather in cinemas). Even being able to predict story points will not take away anything from the experience you can have with this. Enjoy.","29 May 2022","10/10",NA
"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","This Topped and Outgunned the Original","thesar-2","This is one of the best theatrical experiences I've had and I'm so happy someone has taken the practical route rather than throwing everyone into a green screen. I watched the first one many times and I can't believe this just topped it by a huge margin. Tom Cruise will be written as the most passionate filmmaker in history. I mean to put a whole cast in a bunch of f-18 jets and act in a jet as well as film yourself is a huge deal. If this movie does not cross a billion then there is something wrong with taste that people have these days. So called marvel fans. This is what you call a cinematic experience.

It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' (unexplained) absence.Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.A great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.","26 May 2022","10/10",NA

"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","The real cinema experience!","alexglimbergwindh","5 out of 5 stars.Top Gun Maverick is an awesome action film that lives up to the original film and way superior as well. It is one awesome thrill ride that will have the audiences gasping for air with its exhilarating aerial combat scenes.The plot is great. It continues with Maverick (Tom Cruise) being assigned to train new pilots before they go off on a challenging mission. Rooster (Miles Teller) is among the recruits which Maverick tries to reconnect after the incident with his father in the previous film.The plot tries to build an emotional powerhouse as Maverick are neck to neck about the past. And Maverick trying to get these pilots prepared for there first combat.The script is great and fast moving. Director Joseph Kosinski nails making a blockbuster film. Making the action sequences cinematic. And big and loud. Majority of the action scenes are practical and realistic which makes it better. The climatic sequence with the pilots on the mission was awesome and thrilling. Definitely worth seeing this film on the biggest screen with great sound quality.The cast ensemble is great. Tom Cruise nails making a big action film. Cant wait to see what he does with his next films. Miles Teller also was good. Jennifer Connelly playing Mavericks past love interest. The new additions were all great as well. The music score was awesome.The opening sequence gives you the chills with its similiarities to the first.Top Gun Maverick is one of the best films this year. Amazing action sequences that is cinematic and big. And big film that deserves to be seen in theatres.","25 May 2022","10/10",NA
"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","What an excellent sequel","r96sk","See? This is why I LOVE Tom Cruise Post-Mid-1992. Aside from the RARE misfire, cough, cough, The Mummy, when Tom Cruise wants a movie to be better than perfect, he pushes it past Mach 10.The first half of this adventure made me feel this is the perfect and worthy sequel to the original. AND THEN...the second half kicked in thoroughly SURPASSING the original by a landslide. Now, it certainly will not have the impact on the 2020s as the original did for the 1980s - that's lightning that can't be caught twice. But, rest assured: this simultaneously saluted the 1986 classic and then told it to hold its beer.Maverick never changed. And just went he was about to use up his seemingly endless supply of luck, he got recruited back into the ""Top Gun"" division to get the elite ready for a, dare I?, almost Impossible Mission. Oh, and there's a ton of drama and obligatory dick-measuring thrown in.What matters most is: the setup for the film takes place perfectly in the first act giving us clear direction (something the original lacked,) and gave us goals with character building to anticipate and cheer on. When the climax began, it's WAS exactly what I wanted, until it went on another 15 minutes to make the movie SOAR beyond my expectations.While the acting was superb from the Veterans, it wasn't all that great from the fresh new recruits. That was to be expected. Much like their characters in the movie, they're learning to be the best. And they may someday.The movie's music is not as great as the original, but the movie used it sparingly, correctly and with some great new tracks. The original knew it had a killer soundtrack and overdid it. This one showed the restraint it needed.If you loved the first one, there's virtually no way you wouldn't love this even more. It's absolutely perfect for those who were there buying tickets for the original and it's also great for newbies so they can learn to appreciate the classics and understand: with age comes experience and that should never be mocked. It should be learned from and used to progress.And to Top it all off, all of the practical stunts and aerial shots made 10x more sense and easier to follow this time around. I just rewatched the original last night for only the second time (the first being on home video in 2015) and my head was literally spinning to follow the action in the sky. Here, they make sure no one is left in the dust.I can't recommend this movie enough and to see it in theatres, preferably a Dolby-certified one. Don't wait for Paramount+ to pick this up (like I normally would.) Go see this now on the big screen as it should be seen and don't miss out like I did with the original in 1986.***Final Thoughts: I *just* made my Top Ten Tom Cruise movie list, time to update it:1.

"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","Tom Cruise really knows how a blockbuster film is made.","cruise01","It makes more than sense to have seen the first Maverick movie. I am writing this with that in mind. Actually I would even argue that the rating also had something to do with it. Watching it on the big screen also helps a lot of course. My summary line is actually a quote from the movie. Not just the first one, but one that is being said here too. And you will get the full impact of that sentence, of those words, if you know what they mean and why they are said.There are quite a few connections to the first movie, but there is also nods to real life. Especially with Val Kilmer in mind. And all is serving the story - even the real life struggle Kilmer has, that gets woven into the character Iceman. So there are two of the big stars of the first one name checked - what about Kelly McGillis though? Well don't hold your breath (it is being taken away, sorry for the pun)! She is not returning. Now you could be mad at the movie for that - or you could salute it for bringing ""back"" a character that was only name checked in the first movie - and being played by the wonderful Jennifer Connely.Now is she as beautiful as ever? Yes. But she is also close to the age of Tom Cruise that some other names could have been. Of course do not overthink the age thing, because you'd find that her real age would have been inappropriate during the time of the first movie ... just saying. Again: do not overthink it at all.Those things out of the way, we get introduced to a whole bunch of new characters. There probably is not as much ... well male on male energy here as there was in the first one. Even in the dialog - you just feel it. Don't give me that look (and yes I know it is the only one you've got - especially when I bring the puns)! There is more than a coherent story - and the movie takes its time to tell it. There is plenty of action too.There is also technical talk that I didn't totally understand. But it is not necessary to get the movie or enjoy it. And then there is the ending - and what a perfect ending this has. So much so, that I decided it deserves the 10 rating I finally gave it. It may copy many things from the first movie (call it homage), especially the intro but also some story beats, but it still stands ... or rather flies on its own! Just buckle your seatbelt, because you may get dizzy.First time watching I could spot the music cues from the first one, but there were also some fresh elements to it. If I didn't know Lady Gaga was at least partly (big parts if I understood correctly) responsible for the soundtrack, I wouldn't have guessed myself to be honest. As it is, one of the biggest highlights in cinemas this year - the waiting was worth it. If you feel the need .. the need for speed - your need will be satisfied here (or rather in cinemas). Even being able to predict story points will not take away anything from the experience you can have with this. Enjoy.","29 May 2022","10/10",NA
"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","This Topped and Outgunned the Original","thesar-2","This is one of the best theatrical experiences I've had and I'm so happy someone has taken the practical route rather than throwing everyone into a green screen. I watched the first one many times and I can't believe this just topped it by a huge margin. Tom Cruise will be written as the most passionate filmmaker in history. I mean to put a whole cast in a bunch of f-18 jets and act in a jet as well as film yourself is a huge deal. If this movie does not cross a billion then there is something wrong with taste that people have these days. So called marvel fans. This is what you call a cinematic experience.

"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","The truly epic blockbuster we needed.","Top_Dawg_Critic","In one of the more memorable lines in the original Top Gun, Maverick gets chewed out by a superior who tells him, ""Son, your ego's writing checks your body can't cash."" Sometimes I wonder if Tom Cruise took that putdown as a personal challenge. No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he's as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he's ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise's regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They're tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, ""Hold My Hand."" It's nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie's ""Take My Breath Away,"" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you're really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that's because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he's trying to show us that there's room for the old and the new to coexist. He's also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions.","26 May 2022","10/10",NA

Now, it certainly will not have the impact on the 2020s as the original did for the 1980s - that's lightning that can't be caught twice. But, rest assured: this simultaneously saluted the 1986 classic and then told it to hold its beer.Maverick never changed.

Oh, and there's a ton of drama and obligatory dick-measuring thrown in.What matters most is: the setup for the film takes place perfectly in the first act giving us clear direction (something the original lacked,) and gave us goals with character building to anticipate and cheer on. When the climax began, it's WAS exactly what I wanted, until it went on another 15 minutes to make the movie SOAR beyond my expectations.While the acting was superb from the Veterans, it wasn't all that great from the fresh new recruits. That was to be expected. Much like their characters in the movie, they're learning to be the best. And they may someday.The movie's music is not as great as the original, but the movie used it sparingly, correctly and with some great new tracks. The original knew it had a killer soundtrack and overdid it. This one showed the restraint it needed.If you loved the first one, there's virtually no way you wouldn't love this even more. It's absolutely perfect for those who were there buying tickets for the original and it's also great for newbies so they can learn to appreciate the classics and understand: with age comes experience and that should never be mocked. It should be learned from and used to progress.And to Top it all off, all of the practical stunts and aerial shots made 10x more sense and easier to follow this time around. I just rewatched the original last night for only the second time (the first being on home video in 2015) and my head was literally spinning to follow the action in the sky. Here, they make sure no one is left in the dust.I can't recommend this movie enough and to see it in theatres, preferably a Dolby-certified one. Don't wait for Paramount+ to pick this up (like I normally would.) Go see this now on the big screen as it should be seen and don't miss out like I did with the original in 1986.***Final Thoughts: I *just* made my Top Ten Tom Cruise movie list, time to update it:1.

"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","Tom Cruise really knows how a blockbuster film is made.","cruise01","It makes more than sense to have seen the first Maverick movie. I am writing this with that in mind. Actually I would even argue that the rating also had something to do with it. Watching it on the big screen also helps a lot of course. My summary line is actually a quote from the movie. Not just the first one, but one that is being said here too. And you will get the full impact of that sentence, of those words, if you know what they mean and why they are said.There are quite a few connections to the first movie, but there is also nods to real life. Especially with Val Kilmer in mind. And all is serving the story - even the real life struggle Kilmer has, that gets woven into the character Iceman. So there are two of the big stars of the first one name checked - what about Kelly McGillis though? Well don't hold your breath (it is being taken away, sorry for the pun)! She is not returning. Now you could be mad at the movie for that - or you could salute it for bringing ""back"" a character that was only name checked in the first movie - and being played by the wonderful Jennifer Connely.Now is she as beautiful as ever? Yes. But she is also close to the age of Tom Cruise that some other names could have been. Of course do not overthink the age thing, because you'd find that her real age would have been inappropriate during the time of the first movie ... just saying. Again: do not overthink it at all.Those things out of the way, we get introduced to a whole bunch of new characters. There probably is not as much ... well male on male energy here as there was in the first one. Even in the dialog - you just feel it. Don't give me that look (and yes I know it is the only one you've got - especially when I bring the puns)! There is more than a coherent story - and the movie takes its time to tell it. There is plenty of action too.There is also technical talk that I didn't totally understand. But it is not necessary to get the movie or enjoy it. And then there is the ending - and what a perfect ending this has. So much so, that I decided it deserves the 10 rating I finally gave it. It may copy many things from the first movie (call it homage), especially the intro but also some story beats, but it still stands ... or rather flies on its own! Just buckle your seatbelt, because you may get dizzy.First time watching I could spot the music cues from the first one, but there were also some fresh elements to it. If I didn't know Lady Gaga was at least partly (big parts if I understood correctly) responsible for the soundtrack, I wouldn't have guessed myself to be honest. As it is, one of the biggest highlights in cinemas this year - the waiting was worth it. If you feel the need .. the need for speed - your need will be satisfied here (or rather in cinemas).

I watched the first one many times and I can't believe this just topped it by a huge margin. Tom Cruise will be written as the most passionate filmmaker in history. I mean to put a whole cast in a bunch of f-18 jets and act in a jet as well as film yourself is a huge deal. If this movie does not cross a billion then there is something wrong with taste that people have these days. So called marvel fans. This is what you call a cinematic experience.

"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","The truly epic blockbuster we needed.","Top_Dawg_Critic","In one of the more memorable lines in the original Top Gun, Maverick gets chewed out by a superior who tells him, ""Son, your ego's writing checks your body can't cash."" Sometimes I wonder if Tom Cruise took that putdown as a personal challenge. No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he's as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he's ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise's regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They're tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, ""Hold My Hand."" It's nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie's ""Take My Breath Away,"" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you're really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that's because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he's trying to show us that there's room for the old and the new to coexist. He's also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions.","26 May 2022","10/10",NA

"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","This is why we go to the movies","dtucker86","What an excellent sequel - I, in fact, like it more than its predecessor.'Top Gun: Maverick' is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.The story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' (unexplained) absence.Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.A great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.","26 May 2022","10/10",NA
"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","Let me just say...","lovefalloutkindagamer","Top Gun (1986) made Tom Cruise a star, and now 36 years later he jumps back in role of Pete Mitchell AKA Maverick almost like he never left.Maverick never seems let his age slow him down, and still is cocky has ever, and is ordered to train a bunch of young pilots for a deadly mission, but sees a little bit of himself in them, and must get them working together has a team.Tom Cruise is great has Maverick, who is coming to terms with the past. Miles Teller and Glen Powell are also great, and not to mention Jennifer Connelly. But the flying scenes are what makes this movie, you feel like your flying with them. Feels has real has ever. A terrific sequel 36 years worth the wait.","30 May 2022","10/10",NA
"Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)","The real cinema experience!","alexglimbergwindh","5 out of 5 stars.Top Gun Maverick is an awesome action film that lives up to the original film and way superior as well. It is one awesome thrill ride that will have the audiences gasping for air with its exhilarating aerial combat scenes.The plot is great. It continues with Maverick (Tom Cruise) being assigned to train new pilots before they go off on a challenging mission. Rooster (Miles Teller) is among the recruits which Maverick tries to reconnect after the incident with his father in the previous film.The plot tries to build an emotional powerhouse as Maverick are neck to neck about the past. And Maverick trying to get these pilots prepared for there first combat.The script is great and fast moving. Director Joseph Kosinski nails making a blockbuster film. Making the action sequences cinematic. And big and loud. Majority of the action scenes are practical and realistic which makes it better. The climatic sequence with the pilots on the mission was awesome and thrilling. Definitely worth seeing this film on the biggest screen with great sound quality.The cast ensemble is great. Tom Cruise nails making a big action film. Cant wait to see what he does with his next films. Miles Teller also was good. Jennifer Connelly playing Mavericks past love interest. The new additions were all great as well. The music score was awesome.The opening sequence gives you the chills with its similiarities to the first.Top Gun Maverick is one of the best films this year. Amazing action sequences that is cinematic and big. And big film that deserves to be seen in theatres.","25 May 2022","10/10",NA

"Boiling Point (I) (2021)","a remarkable one shot take 'chef' movie","dromasca","'Boiling Point', the second film by English director Philip Barantini will be, I think, one of the sensations of the cinematographic year 2021. It has been presented so far in only a few festivals and will meet with the broader public in cinema halls starting in October. There are in this film, bold in form and sensitive in content, the premises of a love story with the audiences.'Boiling Point' is filmed in one shot take, i.e in a single long frame. This is not the first film to use this technique that requires intense training and formidable logistics. My experiences with movies like this are mixed. The film considered by many to be a masterpiece of the genre, Aleksandr Sokurov's 'Russian Ark' tired and annoyed me (I apologize to the fans of the director or the film for my blunt opinion). Even '1917' (which cheated a little with the technical process) did not excite me, I did not find the connection between story and technique except at the level of gimmick. On the other side, I was enthusiastic about 'Victoria' by the German director
Sebastian Schipper, the description of a tumultuous Berlin night lived by a young Spanish immigrant. I gave it a rare 10/10 rating on IMDB. To a large extent, 'Boiling Point' comes close to this level, and it has helped me understand when one shot take filming works well for me. Life itself, as we live it, is a single take film or, if you will, a series with single-take episodes and sleep breaks. Realistic dramas that happen in real time and in one place or in places connected by the movements of the characters fit the formula perfectly. This is exactly the case with 'Boling Point', which takes place in the kitchen and dining room of a high-end restaurant. After watching for a few minutes the movements of the camera (handled by Matthew Lewis) the story and the characters absorbed me and I forgot (for a while at least) the technical aspects. This is the best sign of success.Before becoming a director, Philip Barantini was an actor and ... a chef. His previous two professions helped him considerably and contributed to the quality of the film. The director knows perfectly the secrets of cuisine, the organisation of the kitchen and of the services in a good restaurant, and especially the people who work in these institutions at the top of the culinary industry and art. Understanding the environment and knowing the actors helped him select an excellent team, made up of mostly experienced actors, many with dozens of movies in their filmographies, who did not refuse to play supporting roles, some with short screen time, but all significant. Of course, Stephen Graham stands out in the role of Andy, the talented chef who faces during the 90 minutes of the film and of the events on the screen the tough problems in the restaurant and in his personal life. I have been following the evolution of Stephen Graham for some time and in my opinion he has now become one of the best actors in British cinema.I hope that 'Boiling Point' will enjoy a good promotion. I believe that those who see it will enjoy an original cinematic work, which adds a new dimension to the restaurants and chefs films genre. It may also be that the customer experience and appreciation of the staff when they dine next time at such a top restaurant will be different as well.","23 March 2022","9/10",NA

You are there. You are part of the team. In terms of acting, all are on a great level, but let me take a moment for Stephen Graham and Vinette Robinson: both absolutely perfect, flawless!

"Boiling Point (I) (2021)","A riveting night","lareval","Breathtakingly shot in a single take and set entirely within a restaurant, Boiling Point captures the stresses and strains of working in this environment. Stephen Graham leads a brilliant ensemble cast all improvising a skeleton script. Who would have thought a seemingly normal night in a restaurant could provide such drama and tension. A must see 8.5 out of ten. A Q&A with some of the cast, the director and the brilliant director of photography was a nice bonus. They were meant to shoot it 8 times and choose the best of the 8.

"Boiling Point (I) (2021)","Has a documentary 'fly on the wall' feel","cathyannemoore-66196","You wouldn't think a film set in a kitchen over one fateful night would be the stuff of white knuckle tension but in adapting their short film of the same name for a feature length affair, director Philip Barantini and his star Stephen Graham have crafted one of 2021's most sweat inducing rides that is a technical accomplishment as well as a storytelling one, that is sure to make you reevaluate the life of busy kitchen/restaurant.Filmed in one long continuous take that only ratchets up the uneasy vibes and hectic nature of chef Andy Jones and his restaurants staff workload, Boiling Point never lets up from the moment we and Andy first walk through the door of his establishment and confront a health inspector that sets up a busy night in the worst way possible that will bring everything to a head in a life changing way as the night goes on.On a hot streak at the moment with 2021 giving him some of his most notable roles yet in the likes of underrated TV shows The North Water and Time and memorable Covid-19 themed TV movie Help, Stephen Graham is a revelation here as Andy with the well liked performer bringing his famed intensity and vulnerability to the flawed chef who is clearly not in a good state personally or professionally as he tries to keep his head above water with mounting problems weighing him down every chance they get.A clear standout in the acting stakes, everyone involved in Boiling Point gives it a good go even if because of the nature of these one take films you do sometimes feel like reactions or moments are slightly off with the ensemble unable to request a simple retake on their scenes but as a whole, Barantini and his cast and crew have crafted a far above average TV film that pushes itself to achieve something great rather than take the easy options it could've easily taken.Sticking to its guns and offering an unflattering yet no doubt honest depiction of modern day chef work, restaurant management and the pressures of work life many face on a day to day basis, Boiling Point might not exactly be feel good material but it's a thrilling exercise nonetheless.Final Say -Offering an unrelenting viewing experience that's anchored by the always great Stephen Graham, Boiling Point is a sizzling dramatic thriller that offers a fascinating insight to the restaurant sub-culture.4 water bottles out of 5Check out Jordan and Eddie for more reviews.","19 December 2021","10/10",NA

"Boiling Point (I) (2021)","An absolute achievement","jaimemedina-36288","Originally this film hit the UK cinemas. And this is one type of film which never would normally make the cinemas except for two special reasons.First, do not expect a storyline as such. It is just a night in a trendy restaurant, concentrating on the stresses of the job, the variance in customers and how the staff work and cope.The main character, Tony )Stephen Graham), most likely Britain's best current actor who has been at his peak for years, and is no less so in the kitchen as head chef.Unfortunately, it is obvious right from the start that although he tries to be a 'Gordon Ramsey' type head chef, that due to personal problems he is not at the top of his game.He does however, have great actors (both staff and customers), which make this kitchen seem like many other restaurants out there, or offices, shops, care homes etc. In other words, he has a fabulous assistant chef, both experienced and non experienced kitchen staff, hard workers and Shirker's, and the customers range from the fakery polite to the downright rude.Second the film is one and a half hours of life in the restaurant. What also makes this film amazing is that it is set in one shot. If one of the actors fluffed their lines, the whole thing would have had to be filmed again. But it is so expertly done, you never notice even when you know.I cannot stop mentioning the acting. Of course Stephen Graham could have carried this by himself, but the fact every member of the cast put in the perfect performance elevated it from TV status to cinema worthy.You really feel for a lot of the characters, their stress, their team spirit, the pressure. The fact some feel rightly undervalued and that others don't deserve a job there.I started this by saying it doesn't have a story, but it does have a beginning, middle and end and an obvious conclusion which does not at all take away from the film. Infact it improves it, because you are left waiting for the ending to happen. And when it does happen, you find out a little more than you realised or expected, tho perhaps suspected.I finished watching this and could not wait to review it, just like I cannot wait to watch it again.Truly amazing and if this does not get awards which everybody in the film should be proud of, there is no justice in the world.I have never given a 10 but this is the furst.","5 February 2022","10/10",NA
"Boiling Point (I) (2021)","a remarkable one shot take 'chef' movie","dromasca","'Boiling Point', the second film by English director Philip Barantini will be, I think, one of the sensations of the cinematographic year 2021. It has been presented so far in only a few festivals and will meet with the broader public in cinema halls starting in October. There are in this film, bold in form and sensitive in content, the premises of a love story with the audiences.'Boiling Point' is filmed in one shot take, i.e in a single long frame. This is not the first film to use this technique that requires intense training and formidable logistics. My experiences with movies like this are mixed. The film considered by many to be a masterpiece of the genre, Aleksandr Sokurov's 'Russian Ark' tired and annoyed me (I apologize to the fans of the director or the film for my blunt opinion). Even '1917' (which cheated a little with the technical process) did not excite me, I did not find the connection between story and technique except at the level of gimmick. On the other side, I was enthusiastic about 'Victoria' by the German director
Sebastian Schipper, the description of a tumultuous Berlin night lived by a young Spanish immigrant. I gave it a rare 10/10 rating on IMDB. To a large extent, 'Boiling Point' comes close to this level, and it has helped me understand when one shot take filming works well for me. Life itself, as we live it, is a single take film or, if you will, a series with single-take episodes and sleep breaks. Realistic dramas that happen in real time and in one place or in places connected by the movements of the characters fit the formula perfectly. This is exactly the case with 'Boling Point', which takes place in the kitchen and dining room of a high-end restaurant. After watching for a few minutes the movements of the camera (handled by Matthew Lewis) the story and the characters absorbed me and I forgot (for a while at least) the technical aspects. This is the best sign of success.Before becoming a director, Philip Barantini was an actor and ... a chef. His previous two professions helped him considerably and contributed to the quality of the film. The director knows perfectly the secrets of cuisine, the organisation of the kitchen and of the services in a good restaurant, and especially the people who work in these institutions at the top of the culinary industry and art. Understanding the environment and knowing the actors helped him select an excellent team, made up of mostly experienced actors, many with dozens of movies in their filmographies, who did not refuse to play supporting roles, some with short screen time, but all significant. Of course, Stephen Graham stands out in the role of Andy, the talented chef who faces during the 90 minutes of the film and of the events on the screen the tough problems in the restaurant and in his personal life. I have been following the evolution of Stephen Graham for some time and in my opinion he has now become one of the best actors in British cinema.I hope that 'Boiling Point' will enjoy a good promotion. I believe that those who see it will enjoy an original cinematic work, which adds a new dimension to the restaurants and chefs films genre. It may also be that the customer experience and appreciation of the staff when they dine next time at such a top restaurant will be different as well.","23 March 2022","9/10",NA

And this is one type of film which never would normally make the cinemas except for two special reasons.First, do not expect a storyline as such.

"Boiling Point (I) (2021)","An absolute achievement","jaimemedina-36288","Originally this film hit the UK cinemas. And this is one type of film which never would normally make the cinemas except for two special reasons.First, do not expect a storyline as such. It is just a night in a trendy restaurant, concentrating on the stresses of the job, the variance in customers and how the staff work and cope.The main character, Tony )Stephen Graham), most likely Britain's best current actor who has been at his peak for years, and is no less so in the kitchen as head chef.Unfortunately, it is obvious right from the start that although he tries to be a 'Gordon Ramsey' type head chef, that due to personal problems he is not at the top of his game.He does however, have great actors (both staff and customers), which make this kitchen seem like many other restaurants out there, or offices, shops, care homes etc. In other words, he has a fabulous assistant chef, both experienced and non experienced kitchen staff, hard workers and Shirker's, and the customers range from the fakery polite to the downright rude.Second the film is one and a half hours of life in the restaurant. What also makes this film amazing is that it is set in one shot. If one of the actors fluffed their lines, the whole thing would have had to be filmed again. But it is so expertly done, you never notice even when you know.I cannot stop mentioning the acting. Of course Stephen Graham could have carried this by himself, but the fact every member of the cast put in the perfect performance elevated it from TV status to cinema worthy.You really feel for a lot of the characters, their stress, their team spirit, the pressure. The fact some feel rightly undervalued and that others don't deserve a job there.I started this by saying it doesn't have a story, but it does have a beginning, middle and end and an obvious conclusion which does not at all take away from the film. Infact it improves it, because you are left waiting for the ending to happen. And when it does happen, you find out a little more than you realised or expected, tho perhaps suspected.I finished watching this and could not wait to review it, just like I cannot wait to watch it again.Truly amazing and if this does not get awards which everybody in the film should be proud of, there is no justice in the world.I have never given a 10 but this is the furst.","5 February 2022","10/10",NA
"Boiling Point (I) (2021)","a remarkable one shot take 'chef' movie","dromasca","'Boiling Point', the second film by English director Philip Barantini will be, I think, one of the sensations of the cinematographic year 2021. It has been presented so far in only a few festivals and will meet with the broader public in cinema halls starting in October. There are in this film, bold in form and sensitive in content, the premises of a love story with the audiences.'Boiling Point' is filmed in one shot take, i.e in a single long frame. This is not the first film to use this technique that requires intense training and formidable logistics. My experiences with movies like this are mixed. The film considered by many to be a masterpiece of the genre, Aleksandr Sokurov's 'Russian Ark' tired and annoyed me (I apologize to the fans of the director or the film for my blunt opinion). Even '1917' (which cheated a little with the technical process) did not excite me, I did not find the connection between story and technique except at the level of gimmick. On the other side, I was enthusiastic about 'Victoria' by the German director
Sebastian Schipper, the description of a tumultuous Berlin night lived by a young Spanish immigrant. I gave it a rare 10/10 rating on IMDB. To a large extent, 'Boiling Point' comes close to this level, and it has helped me understand when one shot take filming works well for me. Life itself, as we live it, is a single take film or, if you will, a series with single-take episodes and sleep breaks. Realistic dramas that happen in real time and in one place or in places connected by the movements of the characters fit the formula perfectly. This is exactly the case with 'Boling Point', which takes place in the kitchen and dining room of a high-end restaurant. After watching for a few minutes the movements of the camera (handled by Matthew Lewis) the story and the characters absorbed me and I forgot (for a while at least) the technical aspects. This is the best sign of success.Before becoming a director, Philip Barantini was an actor and ... a chef. His previous two professions helped him considerably and contributed to the quality of the film. The director knows perfectly the secrets of cuisine, the organisation of the kitchen and of the services in a good restaurant, and especially the people who work in these institutions at the top of the culinary industry and art. Understanding the environment and knowing the actors helped him select an excellent team, made up of mostly experienced actors, many with dozens of movies in their filmographies, who did not refuse to play supporting roles, some with short screen time, but all significant. Of course, Stephen Graham stands out in the role of Andy, the talented chef who faces during the 90 minutes of the film and of the events on the screen the tough problems in the restaurant and in his personal life. I have been following the evolution of Stephen Graham for some time and in my opinion he has now become one of the best actors in British cinema.I hope that 'Boiling Point' will enjoy a good promotion. I believe that those who see it will enjoy an original cinematic work, which adds a new dimension to the restaurants and chefs films genre. It may also be that the customer experience and appreciation of the staff when they dine next time at such a top restaurant will be different as well.","23 March 2022","9/10",NA

You are there. You are part of the team. In terms of acting, all are on a great level, but let me take a moment for Stephen Graham and Vinette Robinson: both absolutely perfect, flawless! There are great scenes that will stay with me - some not including neither of these two characters - and I'm really curious to see what this director can bring us next.","27 December 2021","8/10",NA

A must see 8.5 out of ten. A Q&A with some of the cast, the director and the brilliant director of photography was a nice bonus. They were meant to shoot it 8 times and choose the best of the 8.

The Batman is told almost as a crime noir, made in a way that you could watch it in black and white to enjoy a different perspective.Interesting in that it's a real exploration of the character, his past and family, we get a sense as to why this Batman is so haunted.I wasn't blown away when I heard that Robert Pattinson was cast as Batman, Vengeance, but I was won over very quickly by him, clearly penned as a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, this incarnation is dark, haunted, relentless, but strong and determined. Don't expect laughs or lighter moments, there aren't any.Andy Serkis awesome as always, I thought Colin Farrell and Paul Dano were great too.Great visuals throughout, Gotham looks terrific, and there are some terrific special effects, and a few duff ones too. I think Pattinson looked awesome in the costume, it was well designed.The music was fantastic I thought, one of the movie's best elements, interesting seeing so much carnage played out to Ave Maria, a real juxtaposition.I wish I could say it was without any flaws, as it is an epic, imaginative reimagining, one that deserved its success, however pacing is an issue, it feels long for the sake of being long at times, some scenes are painfully drawn out. Some of the dialogue was hard to make our at times too, was it me, or was some of it a little muffled?What I really didn't like though, the ending, that has to knock a couple of stars of the rating, it just didn't work.Interesting to see what comes next, this was an imaginative retelling.7/10.","2 March 2022","7/10",NA
"The Batman (2022)","Everything I wanted and more","jtindahouse","The Riddler(Paul Dano, spot-on. How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.I really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.Something that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of Batman. 9/10.","5 March 2022","10/10",NA
"The Batman (2022)","Perhaps not the definitive version, but definitely a worthwhile take","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","Matt Reeves The Batman is a hell of a movie, it is the darkest live action Batman movie ever made, and the longest one too, The Batman fills with a top notch action sequence that not only exciting, but it's cinematic too, the cinematography was just incredible, Michael Giacchino The Batman theme song has just become one of my favorite movie theme song ever, it's enduringly great, the action is perfect itself without the theme but they making it even more perfect with the theme in the background especially when Batman shows up, it really making me hyped more because of that, Colin Farrell transformation is as amazing as his performance as The Penguin, Paul Dano performance is giving me a Heath Ledger Joker vibes but not trying to be Heath Ledger Joker which is still great, Paul Dano The Riddler is still a terrifying and a very disturbing villain, Zoe Kravits performances as Catwoman was amazing though she is not as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns but boy did her gesture and look is as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer, and the Catwoman fighting sequence is definitely a win for Zoe and i did still like her a lot in here, and in the end we got The Batman himself, Robert Pattinson, all i can say about him as The Batman is that i hope everybody is starting to know him as the guy who play The Batman which is a really good movie and not the guy who play in the horrible Twilight film anymore because he is indeed an awesome Batman, now he was become my second favorite Batman next to Christian Bale in number one still, the story of The Batman itself is great, and my only problem with the movie is that there is quite a lot of particular scene that for me are just very slow or too slow, it's not boring but i feel like they can make it a little bit faster, if it's only one or two or three scene i probably still can forgive it but unfortunately it happens more than that, but at in the end The Batman is still a hell of a great movie, it's still amazing and it's still incredible, i was impress by most of the thing that happens, i was excited, i was hyped, i was stunt by all the amazing thing that they've done, The Batman is fire!!!.","2 March 2022","9/10",NA

It's super dark and grounded in reality, even more than the Nolan trilogy. And it feels true to the character. Zoe Kravitz and Jeffrey Wright are great casting choices. It's a mostly well-made film and a good addition to the franchise. And the Bat suit looks awesome.At the same time, nothing about this movie wowed me. I did not connect with the characters, especially the villain. The relationships seem undeveloped and not organic. I was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as I should have been. It mostly feels surface level.If you're a huge Batman fan, I think you will really enjoy it. But as a movie, I don't think it fires on all cylinders. The Nolan trilogy still reigns supreme.

Arresting visuals thanks in large part to ace cinematography by Greig Fraser and James Chinlund's production design all aided by the foreboding score by Michael Giacchino full of bombast and dread.

"The Batman (2022)","Melodramatic, monstrously long, mediocre, and boring.","jegd-847-631407","I will say I liked the story, but the long dragged out and slowly paced near 3 hours was ridiculous. You could watch this at 1.5x speed and it would be more enjoyable. This needed at least 20 mins cut out and much faster storytelling. And the constant whisper dialogue in most of the film became annoying really fast.I do like Pattinson as an actor, but not as Batman in this one. He wasn't convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and Emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy. And that's him both as Batman and even more so as Bruce Wayne.And what's with Colin Farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the Penguin? Was every other actor that naturally has that character's look unavailable? It's not like Farrell has a particular set of Penguin skills lol. Casting Farrell as Batman and Pattinson as Penguin, now that would've worked much better imo.I'm also a big fan of Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, but here again, he was very unconvincing as Gordon, especially when he also had that monotonic whispering Emo demeanor. I get that director and joint writer Reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme, but instead, the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throats.The only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful Kravitz, who stole the entire show. I would've rather watched a 4+ hour movie with just her as Catwoman.All the Affleck, Keaton, Bale, Kilmer and even Clooney Batman characters were much more convincing, as well as having more and better ""keep you awake"" action in said films.Sadly, this one is a generous yet disappointing 6/10 from me.","4 March 2022","4/10",NA

Filmmaker Matt Reeves pulls out all the stops in this even darker adaptation of the Bob Kane comic book hero with Pattinson standing tall and brooding as Bruce Wayne employing vigilante style justice as The Caped Cursader while Gotham quakes under the siege of the homicidal Riddler (Dano affectively disturbing) and gaining an unlikely ally in Selina Kyle (ass-kicking Kravitz in pre-Catwoman mode).

"The Batman (2022)","Melodramatic, monstrously long, mediocre, and boring.","jegd-847-631407","I will say I liked the story, but the long dragged out and slowly paced near 3 hours was ridiculous. You could watch this at 1.5x speed and it would be more enjoyable. This needed at least 20 mins cut out and much faster storytelling. And the constant whisper dialogue in most of the film became annoying really fast.I do like Pattinson as an actor, but not as Batman in this one. He wasn't convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and Emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy. And that's him both as Batman and even more so as Bruce Wayne.And what's with Colin Farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the Penguin? Was every other actor that naturally has that character's look unavailable? It's not like Farrell has a particular set of Penguin skills lol. Casting Farrell as Batman and Pattinson as Penguin, now that would've worked much better imo.I'm also a big fan of Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, but here again, he was very unconvincing as Gordon, especially when he also had that monotonic whispering Emo demeanor. I get that director and joint writer Reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme, but instead, the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throats.The only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful Kravitz, who stole the entire show. I would've rather watched a 4+ hour movie with just her as Catwoman.All the Affleck, Keaton, Bale, Kilmer and even Clooney Batman characters were much more convincing, as well as having more and better ""keep you awake"" action in said films.Sadly, this one is a generous yet disappointing 6/10 from me.","4 March 2022","4/10",NA

It's a mostly well-made film and a good addition to the franchise. And the Bat suit looks awesome.At the same time, nothing about this movie wowed me. I did not connect with the characters, especially the villain. The relationships seem undeveloped and not organic. I was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as I should have been. It mostly feels surface level.If you're a huge Batman fan, I think you will really enjoy it. But as a movie, I don't think it fires on all cylinders. The Nolan trilogy still reigns supreme.

"The Batman (2022)","Melodramatic, monstrously long, mediocre, and boring.","jegd-847-631407","I will say I liked the story, but the long dragged out and slowly paced near 3 hours was ridiculous. You could watch this at 1.5x speed and it would be more enjoyable. This needed at least 20 mins cut out and much faster storytelling. And the constant whisper dialogue in most of the film became annoying really fast.I do like Pattinson as an actor, but not as Batman in this one. He wasn't convincing and his monotonic whispering dialogue and Emo demeanor was very lackluster to the point of cringeworthy. And that's him both as Batman and even more so as Bruce Wayne.And what's with Colin Farrell being cast with all these prosthetics to play the Penguin? Was every other actor that naturally has that character's look unavailable? It's not like Farrell has a particular set of Penguin skills lol. Casting Farrell as Batman and Pattinson as Penguin, now that would've worked much better imo.I'm also a big fan of Westworld's Jeffrey Wright, but here again, he was very unconvincing as Gordon, especially when he also had that monotonic whispering Emo demeanor. I get that director and joint writer Reeves was going for that dark lonely dreary theme, but instead, the characters looked bored and inexperienced actors with sore throats.The only one that nailed their character perfectly was the lovely and beautiful Kravitz, who stole the entire show. I would've rather watched a 4+ hour movie with just her as Catwoman.All the Affleck, Keaton, Bale, Kilmer and even Clooney Batman characters were much more convincing, as well as having more and better ""keep you awake"" action in said films.Sadly, this one is a generous yet disappointing 6/10 from me.","4 March 2022","4/10",NA

"The Batman (2022)","Not For Everyone","slightlymad22","I just got out of The BatmanThis movie really won't be for everyone!! Easily the darkest Batman movie yet. It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.This isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said ""This is a masterpiece"" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.Of the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.On the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It's here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!I was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.","18 December 2022","8/10",NA
"The Batman (2022)","Heavy going, but rewarding, until the ending.","Sleepin_Dragon","A serial killer strikes in Gotham City, killing important political figures, and leaving behind a series of cryptic clues, only Batman can stop him.It's certainly very different to all previous Batman films, it's definitely dark and atmospheric, but the pitch and narrative are very different. The Batman is told almost as a crime noir, made in a way that you could watch it in black and white to enjoy a different perspective.Interesting in that it's a real exploration of the character, his past and family, we get a sense as to why this Batman is so haunted.I wasn't blown away when I heard that Robert Pattinson was cast as Batman, Vengeance, but I was won over very quickly by him, clearly penned as a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, this incarnation is dark, haunted, relentless, but strong and determined. Don't expect laughs or lighter moments, there aren't any.Andy Serkis awesome as always, I thought Colin Farrell and Paul Dano were great too.Great visuals throughout, Gotham looks terrific, and there are some terrific special effects, and a few duff ones too. I think Pattinson looked awesome in the costume, it was well designed.The music was fantastic I thought, one of the movie's best elements, interesting seeing so much carnage played out to Ave Maria, a real juxtaposition.I wish I could say it was without any flaws, as it is an epic, imaginative reimagining, one that deserved its success, however pacing is an issue, it feels long for the sake of being long at times, some scenes are painfully drawn out. Some of the dialogue was hard to make our at times too, was it me, or was some of it a little muffled?What I really didn't like though, the ending, that has to knock a couple of stars of the rating, it just didn't work.Interesting to see what comes next, this was an imaginative retelling.7/10.","2 March 2022","7/10",NA
"The Batman (2022)","Everything I wanted and more","jtindahouse","The Riddler(Paul Dano, spot-on. How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.I really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.Something that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of Batman. 9/10.","5 March 2022","10/10",NA
"The Batman (2022)","Perhaps not the definitive version, but definitely a worthwhile take","TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","Matt Reeves The Batman is a hell of a movie, it is the darkest live action Batman movie ever made, and the longest one too, The Batman fills with a top notch action sequence that not only exciting, but it's cinematic too, the cinematography was just incredible, Michael Giacchino The Batman theme song has just become one of my favorite movie theme song ever, it's enduringly great, the action is perfect itself without the theme but they making it even more perfect with the theme in the background especially when Batman shows up, it really making me hyped more because of that, Colin Farrell transformation is as amazing as his performance as The Penguin, Paul Dano performance is giving me a Heath Ledger Joker vibes but not trying to be Heath Ledger Joker which is still great, Paul Dano The Riddler is still a terrifying and a very disturbing villain, Zoe Kravits performances as Catwoman was amazing though she is not as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer in Batman Returns but boy did her gesture and look is as wild as Michelle Pfeiffer, and the Catwoman fighting sequence is definitely a win for Zoe and i did still like her a lot in here, and in the end we got The Batman himself, Robert Pattinson, all i can say about him as The Batman is that i hope everybody is starting to know him as the guy who play The Batman which is a really good movie and not the guy who play in the horrible Twilight film anymore because he is indeed an awesome Batman, now he was become my second favorite Batman next to Christian Bale in number one still, the story of The Batman itself is great, and my only problem with the movie is that there is quite a lot of particular scene that for me are just very slow or too slow, it's not boring but i feel like they can make it a little bit faster, if it's only one or two or three scene i probably still can forgive it but unfortunately it happens more than that, but at in the end The Batman is still a hell of a great movie, it's still amazing and it's still incredible, i was impress by most of the thing that happens, i was excited, i was hyped, i was stunt by all the amazing thing that they've done, The Batman is fire!!!.","2 March 2022","9/10",NA

"The Banshees of Inisherin (2022)","Two Tribes...","Xstal","It is a well told dark comedy that keeps you wanting more, in a time when Ireland was full of despair, not long after the war of Independence and a long-suffering period that brought about a post-colonial inferiority complex (still hasn't been addressed to this day), a struggle for an identity, a repressive church, superstitions, isolation, mass emigration, poverty and to top it all off a brutal civil war. This film does a great job to put you in the psych of the time and to top that off the cinematography, costumes, music and atmosphere are wonderful. The film is itself a bit of a conundrum, on one hand it leaves you thinking nonstop about the story and the premise, while on the other hand you feel cheated by its abruptness.Pádraic ó Súilleabháin (Colin Farrell) is just a nice man who struggles to deal with losing his friendship with Colm Doherty (Brendan Gleeson) and the further loss he endures. Colm, himself is in a fight against time and his age. The dark struggle of helplessness or despair is rife on the Island, but the story telling is done so well it comes across uplifting at times with light-hearted comedy sprinkled on top. Siobhán ní Súilleabháin (Kerry Condon) is a rock to Pádraic, but she is herself tied to the antics of the Island and Dominic Kearney (Barry Keoghan) must suffer with his own demons while he searches for love.Both leads Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson knock it out of the park, but the two shining stars for me were Barry Keoghan and the beautiful Kerry Condon. I thought the film was going to take a turn for the D'Unbelievables at one point when Pat Shortt who plays Jonjo Devine and Jon Kenny who plays Gerry pop up on the screen, but after a brief scare they turned out to be a good addition to the banter and gossip in the pub scenes.It's not perfect and lets you down in a few areas. Some of the dialogue feels out of place especially for the part of Ireland and the time period, which was a shame, as it transports you out of the screen and back into the cinema (this seems to be a modern trend with period film). The setting was also a bit too squeaky clean; brand new clean clothes, polished teeth, shoes galore, fresh faces (apart from Colin Farrell who did look like he spent years working in the elements) the poverty of the time could have been showcased a bit more.My wife and I both enjoyed this film immensely. Any fan of dark comedy, this film is a must see with a word of warning: I would be aware if you are going to see this movie and you are emotionally fragile, that it does tap into the dark side of your brain and leaves you in deep thought when it is finished.8/10.","25 December 2022","8/10",NA
"The Banshees of Inisherin (2022)","This is a tough one to review...","goshin34","5 years after his brilliant dark comedy ""Three Billboards, Outside Ebbing, Missouri"", Martin Mcdonagh directs another brilliant tale about Friendship, Ambition and Loneliness. The Banshees of Inisherin is the best a Mcdonagh movie has ever looked, every scene has a visual landscape setting and color tone is completely balanced.The movie revolves around 3 arcs and all the 3 have their perfect conclusions and intersect cleverly. It's one of the best writing you will ever see. Like 3 Billboards there is a perfect blend of humour and tragedy. The stories revolve around Colin Farrell coming to terms that his best friend doesn't want to do anything with him, his sister played by Kerry Cordon trying to find the ultimate purpose in her life and Dominic played by Barry Keoghan, who is living a worst life possible.Colin Farrell has been doing some great work over the last 20 years and this is his Eureka, Eureka moment. The Banshees of Inisherin is the best movie of the year so far and deserves both commercial and critical acclaim. Very rarely movies that satisfy everyone are made, this is one of them.","26 October 2022","7/10",NA

Colin Farrell with the most screen time simply shines, having me wish he were more prolific in projects. Brendan Gleeson also does a stellar job, as does Kerry Condon. Even the other minor characters were well written and very well acted by their respective actors. I can't think of a single actor who did a poor job, heck even the animals did a good job. Excellent cinematography as well.However, while the dialogue was extremely well written, the script itself was somewhat lacking.

"The Banshees of Inisherin (2022)","A Shakespearean masterpiece","Couchkik20","As ""The Banchees of Inisherin"" (2022 release from Ireland; 114 min) opens, the Colin Farrell character, a guy named Padriac, stops by the Breandon Gleeson character, a guy named Colm who is Padriac's best friend. That is, until that moment. For reasons unknown, Colm wants nothing more to do with Padriac. ""I just don't like you anymore"" Colm offers. The calendar shows ""April 1, 1923"", and Padriac doesn't take this unexplained change of behavior by Colm very well... At this point we are 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the highly anticipated reunion of writer-director Martin McDonagh, and lead performers Farrell and Gleeson, 14 years after the now classic ""In Bruges"". I too was eager to see how this reunion would play out, but then something completely unexpected happened: I found the Colin Farrell character to be irritating and off-putting, to the point where it was almost too much to bear or see. Without spoiling anything, I will say that things are somewhat better in the movie's second hour. But I could never get into the proper flow of the movie, let alone rave about it as many others have done. I completely understand that my viewpoint is definitely in the minority. And that this film has been hailed critically (it's currently rated 97% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). The most striking thing about the movie for me was the strong performance of Barry Keoghan (who starred in ""Dunkirk"" a few years back). This is a subjective opinion of course.""The Banchees of Inisherin"" premiered at this year's Venice Film Festival to universal acclaim, and opened in theaters a few weeks ago. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended okay (I counted about 15 people).

"The Banshees of Inisherin (2022)","Superb Acting but Little Else","Athanatos173","What starts as an original and funny approach to themes of friendship, loss and self growth slowly takes a dark turn to an unnecessary sequence of macabre events that ultimately end in a not so much satisfactory manner.I have no issues with odd or unorthodox approaches to movie making but I do not personally enjoy when things take violent approaches specially when involving animals (regardless of course of the fact that no animals were really harmed) just for the sake of it... the movie as I mentioned starts with an interesting plot when one man simply decides to stop talking to his long term best friend without any concrete apparent reason for it.The environment, the locations and of course the acting makes the movie and got me interested through half of it, then when the previously mentioned dark events start to happen it becomes strange and it slowly becomes less interesting.I read some of the critics and interpretations of the film and aside from its themes of friendship, depression, human nature it also serves as an apparent metaphor to the real life Irish civil war, similarly to the previous Oscar season where we also had another film debating the same topic.I get the symbolisms but again for me personally they didn't come through to me with this weird darkish comedy approach, I don't feel it's worth of Oscar recognition while I do praise the acting as well as the great atmosphere captured in rural Ireland.","15 December 2022","6/10",NA

"The Banshees of Inisherin (2022)","Two Tribes...","Xstal","It is a well told dark comedy that keeps you wanting more, in a time when Ireland was full of despair, not long after the war of Independence and a long-suffering period that brought about a post-colonial inferiority complex (still hasn't been addressed to this day), a struggle for an identity, a repressive church, superstitions, isolation, mass emigration, poverty and to top it all off a brutal civil war. This film does a great job to put you in the psych of the time and to top that off the cinematography, costumes, music and atmosphere are wonderful. The film is itself a bit of a conundrum, on one hand it leaves you thinking nonstop about the story and the premise, while on the other hand you feel cheated by its abruptness.Pádraic ó Súilleabháin (Colin Farrell) is just a nice man who struggles to deal with losing his friendship with Colm Doherty (Brendan Gleeson) and the further loss he endures. Colm, himself is in a fight against time and his age. The dark struggle of helplessness or despair is rife on the Island, but the story telling is done so well it comes across uplifting at times with light-hearted comedy sprinkled on top. Siobhán ní Súilleabháin (Kerry Condon) is a rock to Pádraic, but she is herself tied to the antics of the Island and Dominic Kearney (Barry Keoghan) must suffer with his own demons while he searches for love.Both leads Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson knock it out of the park, but the two shining stars for me were Barry Keoghan and the beautiful Kerry Condon. I thought the film was going to take a turn for the D'Unbelievables at one point when Pat Shortt who plays Jonjo Devine and Jon Kenny who plays Gerry pop up on the screen, but after a brief scare they turned out to be a good addition to the banter and gossip in the pub scenes.It's not perfect and lets you down in a few areas. Some of the dialogue feels out of place especially for the part of Ireland and the time period, which was a shame, as it transports you out of the screen and back into the cinema (this seems to be a modern trend with period film). The setting was also a bit too squeaky clean; brand new clean clothes, polished teeth, shoes galore, fresh faces (apart from Colin Farrell who did look like he spent years working in the elements) the poverty of the time could have been showcased a bit more.My wife and I both enjoyed this film immensely. Any fan of dark comedy, this film is a must see with a word of warning: I would be aware if you are going to see this movie and you are emotionally fragile, that it does tap into the dark side of your brain and leaves you in deep thought when it is finished.8/10.","25 December 2022","8/10",NA
"The Banshees of Inisherin (2022)","This is a tough one to review...","goshin34","5 years after his brilliant dark comedy ""Three Billboards, Outside Ebbing, Missouri"", Martin Mcdonagh directs another brilliant tale about Friendship, Ambition and Loneliness. The Banshees of Inisherin is the best a Mcdonagh movie has ever looked, every scene has a visual landscape setting and color tone is completely balanced.The movie revolves around 3 arcs and all the 3 have their perfect conclusions and intersect cleverly. It's one of the best writing you will ever see. Like 3 Billboards there is a perfect blend of humour and tragedy. The stories revolve around Colin Farrell coming to terms that his best friend doesn't want to do anything with him, his sister played by Kerry Cordon trying to find the ultimate purpose in her life and Dominic played by Barry Keoghan, who is living a worst life possible.Colin Farrell has been doing some great work over the last 20 years and this is his Eureka, Eureka moment.

"The Banshees of Inisherin (2022)","A Shakespearean masterpiece","Couchkik20","As ""The Banchees of Inisherin"" (2022 release from Ireland; 114 min) opens, the Colin Farrell character, a guy named Padriac, stops by the Breandon Gleeson character, a guy named Colm who is Padriac's best friend. That is, until that moment. For reasons unknown, Colm wants nothing more to do with Padriac. ""I just don't like you anymore"" Colm offers. The calendar shows ""April 1, 1923"", and Padriac doesn't take this unexplained change of behavior by Colm very well... At this point we are 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the highly anticipated reunion of writer-director Martin McDonagh, and lead performers Farrell and Gleeson, 14 years after the now classic ""In Bruges"". I too was eager to see how this reunion would play out, but then something completely unexpected happened: I found the Colin Farrell character to be irritating and off-putting, to the point where it was almost too much to bear or see. Without spoiling anything, I will say that things are somewhat better in the movie's second hour. But I could never get into the proper flow of the movie, let alone rave about it as many others have done. I completely understand that my viewpoint is definitely in the minority. And that this film has been hailed critically (it's currently rated 97% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). The most striking thing about the movie for me was the strong performance of Barry Keoghan (who starred in ""Dunkirk"" a few years back). This is a subjective opinion of course.""The Banchees of Inisherin"" premiered at this year's Venice Film Festival to universal acclaim, and opened in theaters a few weeks ago. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended okay (I counted about 15 people). If you are a fan of Martin McDonagh's earlier work of or Colin Farrell or Brendon Gleeson, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.","15 December 2022","10/10",NA

It is hard not to empathise with the characters and their vicissitudes.

Worlds away from what I've seen on the big screen for some time. You don't know whether to laugh or cry, it truly doesn't follow any of the usual rules.It is such an unusual, but pretty fascinating story, how on Earth can two grown men, two adults that have been friends for a long time, suddenly drift apart, becoming feuding strangers? It does actually happen. The main question here, is what changed, what pushed Colm to this point?A story of ego, pride and stubbornness, it shows how something small can get out of hand, and escalate into something huge.The characters are so rich, not just the two leads, but the likes of Mrs McCormack and the shopkeeper are great.Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell are terrific, it's the best films Farrell has done for years.

That is, until that moment. For reasons unknown, Colm wants nothing more to do with Padriac. ""I just don't like you anymore"" Colm offers. The calendar shows ""April 1, 1923"", and Padriac doesn't take this unexplained change of behavior by Colm very well...

I too was eager to see how this reunion would play out, but then something completely unexpected happened: I found the Colin Farrell character to be irritating and off-putting, to the point where it was almost too much to bear or see. Without spoiling anything, I will say that things are somewhat better in the movie's second hour. But I could never get into the proper flow of the movie, let alone rave about it as many others have done. I completely understand that my viewpoint is definitely in the minority. And that this film has been hailed critically (it's currently rated 97% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes).

Worlds away from what I've seen on the big screen for some time. You don't know whether to laugh or cry, it truly doesn't follow any of the usual rules.It is such an unusual, but pretty fascinating story, how on Earth can two grown men, two adults that have been friends for a long time, suddenly drift apart, becoming feuding strangers? It does actually happen. The main question here, is what changed, what pushed Colm to this point?A story of ego, pride and stubbornness, it shows how something small can get out of hand, and escalate into something huge.The characters are so rich, not just the two leads, but the likes of Mrs McCormack and the shopkeeper are great.Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell are terrific, it's the best films Farrell has done for years.

"The Banshees of Inisherin (2022)","Two Tribes...","Xstal","It is a well told dark comedy that keeps you wanting more, in a time when Ireland was full of despair, not long after the war of Independence and a long-suffering period that brought about a post-colonial inferiority complex (still hasn't been addressed to this day), a struggle for an identity, a repressive church, superstitions, isolation, mass emigration, poverty and to top it all off a brutal civil war. This film does a great job to put you in the psych of the time and to top that off the cinematography, costumes, music and atmosphere are wonderful. The film is itself a bit of a conundrum, on one hand it leaves you thinking nonstop about the story and the premise, while on the other hand you feel cheated by its abruptness.Pádraic ó Súilleabháin (Colin Farrell) is just a nice man who struggles to deal with losing his friendship with Colm Doherty (Brendan Gleeson) and the further loss he endures. Colm, himself is in a fight against time and his age. The dark struggle of helplessness or despair is rife on the Island, but the story telling is done so well it comes across uplifting at times with light-hearted comedy sprinkled on top. Siobhán ní Súilleabháin (Kerry Condon) is a rock to Pádraic, but she is herself tied to the antics of the Island and Dominic Kearney (Barry Keoghan) must suffer with his own demons while he searches for love.Both leads Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson knock it out of the park, but the two shining stars for me were Barry Keoghan and the beautiful Kerry Condon. I thought the film was going to take a turn for the D'Unbelievables at one point when Pat Shortt who plays Jonjo Devine and Jon Kenny who plays Gerry pop up on the screen, but after a brief scare they turned out to be a good addition to the banter and gossip in the pub scenes.It's not perfect and lets you down in a few areas. Some of the dialogue feels out of place especially for the part of Ireland and the time period, which was a shame, as it transports you out of the screen and back into the cinema (this seems to be a modern trend with period film). The setting was also a bit too squeaky clean; brand new clean clothes, polished teeth, shoes galore, fresh faces (apart from Colin Farrell who did look like he spent years working in the elements) the poverty of the time could have been showcased a bit more.My wife and I both enjoyed this film immensely. Any fan of dark comedy, this film is a must see with a word of warning: I would be aware if you are going to see this movie and you are emotionally fragile, that it does tap into the dark side of your brain and leaves you in deep thought when it is finished.8/10.","25 December 2022","8/10",NA
"The Banshees of Inisherin (2022)","This is a tough one to review...","goshin34","5 years after his brilliant dark comedy ""Three Billboards, Outside Ebbing, Missouri"", Martin Mcdonagh directs another brilliant tale about Friendship, Ambition and Loneliness. The Banshees of Inisherin is the best a Mcdonagh movie has ever looked, every scene has a visual landscape setting and color tone is completely balanced.The movie revolves around 3 arcs and all the 3 have their perfect conclusions and intersect cleverly. It's one of the best writing you will ever see. Like 3 Billboards there is a perfect blend of humour and tragedy. The stories revolve around Colin Farrell coming to terms that his best friend doesn't want to do anything with him, his sister played by Kerry Cordon trying to find the ultimate purpose in her life and Dominic played by Barry Keoghan, who is living a worst life possible.Colin Farrell has been doing some great work over the last 20 years and this is his Eureka, Eureka moment. The Banshees of Inisherin is the best movie of the year so far and deserves both commercial and critical acclaim. Very rarely movies that satisfy everyone are made, this is one of them.","26 October 2022","7/10",NA

Until men display a classic story of pride and stubbornness.Like a dark children tale, the movie seems to be a metaphor of the stupidity of war and humanity's contradictions. Collin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and a scene stealing Barry Keoghan are just wonderful at creating those flawed and unique men spiraling into their destiny.

Then, as I sat and thought about everything I had seen, I came to believe more and more that it's kind of genius.What the movie lacks in overt substantive plot it more than makes up for in authenticity and subtle placement of character-building images and dialogue. In the moment, these often feel like tangents and the overall picture isn't clear.While it can make for a frustrating first viewing, the clarity that comes with the film's final shot suddenly puts everything into perspective and I felt an overwhelming flood of emotion for the two central characters.Suffering happen more often than not in silence, and it's the cumulative of this film's many quiet moments that drive home one of the most effective, nuanced messages of compassion that I've seen all year.This is a masterpiece of subtlety, arguably slightly to a fault, but it's refreshing to see it in the age of ""hammer over the head"" messaging in movies that we're currently living in.","26 January 2023","10/10",NA

A reflection of a time when eyes were new, interpretation was a seed, as yet to grow, but when you look back now, it's a different world somehow, revealing spaces not yet entered, or sought to go.It's a slow meander, beautifully filmed, with two incredible performances, although those two highlights alone don't create a piece that takes your breath away as much as you might like, until you sit down to reflect, and absorb what you've seen through your own eyes.","21 December 2022","10/10",NA
" Aftersun (II) (2022)","Understanding takes effort","benjaminskylerhill","I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, ""there are a lot of good songs in this movie"". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.","6 November 2022","9/10",NA

I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok.

" Aftersun (II) (2022)","Demands a second viewing","jtindahouse","This film crept up on me. I was worried it was a gimmicky art film (plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher) but as the film went on I was swept up in it - purely down to Paul Mescal's and Francesca Corio's performances. Achingly beautiful. I was crying without realising and also on the tube home - the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with me.Alison Willmore from Vulture at New York Magazine perfectly articulated what I felt :' It's about wanting to reach across time, and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where, for once, you're both on the same level, and you can finally understand them for who they are - or who they were.'","15 December 2022","9/10",NA
" Aftersun (II) (2022)","A significant message in a film that's like navigating fog with landmines","cetaylor3","It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The ""looking back in fondness"" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.","29 January 2023","8/10",NA
" Aftersun (II) (2022)","A study of loss and regret.","PlutoZoo","""There's This Feeling, Once You Leave Where You Grew Up, That You Don't Totally Belong There Again""For the past few weeks, I've heard and read a lot about people's reactions to this film, and I have seen nothing but unhindered love and affection. I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get enough.","30 January 2023","8/10",NA
" Aftersun (II) (2022)","Great for others","carsonpayne-66437","There are a lot of people here that got emotional watching it. This movie touched their souls. Out of respect for them, i will be very careful as i write my review.I didn't connect with these characters. If i were a woman, or had a daughter, maybe i would empathize more. But i wouldn't bet on this because, generally, i don't need to connect in a personal level with the characters in order to enjoy a movie. I felt in distance because i couldn't understand what i was watching. There were no hints during the first hour that something is wrong. So, what was the point in watching a father and a daughter on their vacations? It was totally uninteresting. I watched it until the ending because acting was great, both Mescal and Corio were excellent. I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did happen, too little, too late. Last 20-25 minutes were more intense, for sure. But still, i couldn't understand the ending. I was searching in the web for an interpretation, what was the meaning of this? At some point, i thought about a different outcome, i thought that the father was a bad person. But, i got it wrong as it seems.There are some good scenes here. When the father and the daughter were dancing under the sound of David Bowie in the end, it was a sad and beautiful scene, especially when you listen to this particular song's lyrics. Chemistry was great, i really felt their love for each other.Subtlety is great when the director is skillful. But never go full subtle. This is a movie, not a poem. A certain level of connection with the events and the characters, is necessary. I love poetic/dream like/art movies. But in this case, i need a strong imagery, deep meanings, substance over style, beautiful cinematography etc. This movie didn't provide me anything of that.I hope i didn't offend anyone.

A lot of things here are absolutely outstanding - the direction, the bond between the two main characters, and the screenplay. All this is great, I was entertained - in a very strange way.

As a Turkish person, its just both amazing and heartbreaking from the point of view of the director that this word resonates with her feelings from a place she had this holiday with her late father. That it stuck with her...Even though it is not the same case at all, I remember the times as a kid I closed the door on my dad because he would come home late from work. That because he would promise me to come home early.Now, today I can't even imagine how saddening it was for him at those times and it wasn't even at his hands.Hopefully I will be able to share my love and gratitude my parents as Charlotte did here with such elegance through some way.

A reflection of a time when eyes were new, interpretation was a seed, as yet to grow, but when you look back now, it's a different world somehow, revealing spaces not yet entered, or sought to go.It's a slow meander, beautifully filmed, with two incredible performances, although those two highlights alone don't create a piece that takes your breath away as much as you might like, until you sit down to reflect, and absorb what you've seen through your own eyes.","21 December 2022","10/10",NA
" Aftersun (II) (2022)","Understanding takes effort","benjaminskylerhill","I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, ""there are a lot of good songs in this movie"". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.","6 November 2022","9/10",NA

" Aftersun (II) (2022)","A significant message in a film that's like navigating fog with landmines","cetaylor3","It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material.

" Aftersun (II) (2022)","A study of loss and regret.","PlutoZoo","""There's This Feeling, Once You Leave Where You Grew Up, That You Don't Totally Belong There Again""For the past few weeks, I've heard and read a lot about people's reactions to this film, and I have seen nothing but unhindered love and affection. I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get enough.","30 January 2023","8/10",NA
" Aftersun (II) (2022)","Great for others","carsonpayne-66437","There are a lot of people here that got emotional watching it. This movie touched their souls. Out of respect for them, i will be very careful as i write my review.I didn't connect with these characters. If i were a woman, or had a daughter, maybe i would empathize more. But i wouldn't bet on this because, generally, i don't need to connect in a personal level with the characters in order to enjoy a movie. I felt in distance because i couldn't understand what i was watching. There were no hints during the first hour that something is wrong. So, what was the point in watching a father and a daughter on their vacations? It was totally uninteresting. I watched it until the ending because acting was great, both Mescal and Corio were excellent. I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did happen, too little, too late. Last 20-25 minutes were more intense, for sure. But still, i couldn't understand the ending. I was searching in the web for an interpretation, what was the meaning of this? At some point, i thought about a different outcome, i thought that the father was a bad person. But, i got it wrong as it seems.There are some good scenes here. When the father and the daughter were dancing under the sound of David Bowie in the end, it was a sad and beautiful scene, especially when you listen to this particular song's lyrics. Chemistry was great, i really felt their love for each other.Subtlety is great when the director is skillful. But never go full subtle. This is a movie, not a poem. A certain level of connection with the events and the characters, is necessary. I love poetic/dream like/art movies. But in this case, i need a strong imagery, deep meanings, substance over style, beautiful cinematography etc. This movie didn't provide me anything of that.I hope i didn't offend anyone.

" Aftersun (II) (2022)","A study of loss and regret.","PlutoZoo","""There's This Feeling, Once You Leave Where You Grew Up, That You Don't Totally Belong There Again""For the past few weeks, I've heard and read a lot about people's reactions to this film, and I have seen nothing but unhindered love and affection. I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get enough.","30 January 2023","8/10",NA
" Aftersun (II) (2022)","Great for others","carsonpayne-66437","There are a lot of people here that got emotional watching it. This movie touched their souls. Out of respect for them, i will be very careful as i write my review.I didn't connect with these characters. If i were a woman, or had a daughter, maybe i would empathize more. But i wouldn't bet on this because, generally, i don't need to connect in a personal level with the characters in order to enjoy a movie. I felt in distance because i couldn't understand what i was watching. There were no hints during the first hour that something is wrong. So, what was the point in watching a father and a daughter on their vacations? It was totally uninteresting. I watched it until the ending because acting was great, both Mescal and Corio were excellent. I was waiting for something to happen, and when it did happen, too little, too late. Last 20-25 minutes were more intense, for sure. But still, i couldn't understand the ending. I was searching in the web for an interpretation, what was the meaning of this? At some point, i thought about a different outcome, i thought that the father was a bad person. But, i got it wrong as it seems.There are some good scenes here. When the father and the daughter were dancing under the sound of David Bowie in the end, it was a sad and beautiful scene, especially when you listen to this particular song's lyrics. Chemistry was great, i really felt their love for each other.Subtlety is great when the director is skillful. But never go full subtle. This is a movie, not a poem. A certain level of connection with the events and the characters, is necessary. I love poetic/dream like/art movies. But in this case, i need a strong imagery, deep meanings, substance over style, beautiful cinematography etc. This movie didn't provide me anything of that.I hope i didn't offend anyone.

" Aftersun (II) (2022)","This Movie Hurt","evanston_dad","Aftersun is a film that I wasn't sure I understood when the credits started rolling. Then, as I sat and thought about everything I had seen, I came to believe more and more that it's kind of genius.What the movie lacks in overt substantive plot it more than makes up for in authenticity and subtle placement of character-building images and dialogue. In the moment, these often feel like tangents and the overall picture isn't clear.While it can make for a frustrating first viewing, the clarity that comes with the film's final shot suddenly puts everything into perspective and I felt an overwhelming flood of emotion for the two central characters.Suffering happen more often than not in silence, and it's the cumulative of this film's many quiet moments that drive home one of the most effective, nuanced messages of compassion that I've seen all year.This is a masterpiece of subtlety, arguably slightly to a fault, but it's refreshing to see it in the age of ""hammer over the head"" messaging in movies that we're currently living in.","26 January 2023","10/10",NA
" Aftersun (II) (2022)","Woman struggle to clarify memories of troubled father","maurice_yacowar","You have a video of a holiday in the past, when you were young, before life's burdens had amassed, with a father you adore, likes to take to the dancefloor, though he's generally withdrawn and quite downcast. A reflection of a time when eyes were new, interpretation was a seed, as yet to grow, but when you look back now, it's a different world somehow, revealing spaces not yet entered, or sought to go.It's a slow meander, beautifully filmed, with two incredible performances, although those two highlights alone don't create a piece that takes your breath away as much as you might like, until you sit down to reflect, and absorb what you've seen through your own eyes.","21 December 2022","10/10",NA
" Aftersun (II) (2022)","Understanding takes effort","benjaminskylerhill","I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, ""there are a lot of good songs in this movie"". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.","6 November 2022","9/10",NA

I understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. I noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. I just did not connect with the film at all. I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok. Don't take my rating too seriously because I can genuinely imagine somebody else watching this film thinking that it is the best thing they ever saw.","28 January 2023","8/10",NA
" Aftersun (II) (2022)","Demands a second viewing","jtindahouse","This film crept up on me. I was worried it was a gimmicky art film (plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher) but as the film went on I was swept up in it - purely down to Paul Mescal's and Francesca Corio's performances. Achingly beautiful. I was crying without realising and also on the tube home - the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with me.Alison Willmore from Vulture at New York Magazine perfectly articulated what I felt :' It's about wanting to reach across time, and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where, for once, you're both on the same level, and you can finally understand them for who they are - or who they were.'","15 December 2022","9/10",NA
" Aftersun (II) (2022)","A significant message in a film that's like navigating fog with landmines","cetaylor3","It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The ""looking back in fondness"" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.","29 January 2023","8/10",NA

But for me, this film was so over-the-top that I continually felt as though I were watching a TV sit-com or vaudeville show. That, not a film during which several central characters actually are murdered. And a murderer must be uncovered.By 'over-the-top' I mean this. (1) The acting was as broad as a slap-stick comedy. (2) The dialogue was not the least bit anchored in anything approaching reality. (3) The look of the film, the overdone brightness and color saturation of the production, made it almost an animated feature. And finally (4) there is the issue of Daniel Craig's dialect, which I have to say I found annoying. At best.A group of people are invited to a Greek Island on which a game will be played. But once there they learn that the game has already begun and that murder, or the prevention of it, is the game's objective. As with Agatha Christy mysteries, each invitee has a reason to murder someone, and with the group unable to depart the island, murder will no doubt take place. But - for the reasons outlined above - we (or 'I') did not care. On the positive side I enjoyed Kate Hudson as an aging beauty. As to the rest of the performances, the less said the better, but Edward Norton as the island's host stands out in terms of his being entirely miscast.I don't want to say more, for fear of giving too much away.So, that's it.

What an absolute let down.I have no complaints about the cast, the score, the cinematography, the direction etc. It's the writing. Did Rian Johnson just forget what sort of film he was writing or something? It certainly showed a lot of promise in the first act, it definitely had me intruiged. The middle act had it's moments of twists and revelations I suppose. But the last act - what happened? What a mess. There was no pay off. It was such an unsatisfying conclusion.

I was, however, disappointed.With Glass Onion, director and writer Rian Johnson shows once again that he can carefully craft an intriguing story with brilliant direction. But with a bigger budget comes many challenges and unfortunately the movie fails when it is trying too be too extravagant and a spectacle for the viewers.The core story is very interesting and after a dull start, the middle of the film really hits it's stride with Johnson moving his playing pieces about with ease and wonderment. That was when i most enjoyed the movie.But the ending was ultimately disappointing. Childish humour and some sequences that were clearly for spectacle which i can only describe as 'throwing a tantrum' ruined this movie for me.I had some fun with this but was left feeling robbed as there was definitely a compelling enough story here for this to be another great movie.

"Glass Onion (2022)","Slow start, exciting middle and childish end...","mazbutt-16041","Watching on the big screen, at its best this would be a solid 8+/10 movie, but there are a few areas that let it down.First is the excessive lockdown/mask/Zoom scenes at the start of the film. This was never good comedic or dramatic material in the first place, and has already aged badly.Second is a somewhat over-the-top finale which aims for spectacular but ends up a bit silly - and that isn't where a murder-mystery should be. Less is more.But the greatest problem is the decision to re-tell the whole story from a different perspective half-way through. After carefully building the tension so that darkness falls with a murderer on the loose... the audience is taken back to the start again. It completely ruins the momentum of the film. Granted, this does allow the reveal to be even more complicated, but it also greatly reduces the wow-factor of Benoit Blanc's deduction. The genius detective solving the case is the fulcrum of this kind of movie and shouldn't be diminished.Production values are high, and the supporting cast are good, although some have fairly slender roles. Kate Hudson is superb as Birdie.In conclusion, I'm pleased to see Blanc back. Daniel Craig brought more eccentricity to the character this time around, but I liked it. A modern-day Poirot. I'd happily see a series of his adventures on the big screen. Just return to a more traditional murder-mystery structure (please).","6 January 2023","6/10",NA
"Glass Onion (2022)","not as good as its previous one","saru2020","I really wanted to like this, but the direction was lacklustre. When you have a very complicated plot, then editing, pacing and direction are critical. This is not nearly as much fun as the first Knives Out, and the dialogue is strained. The players try very hard, but it's all a jumble of dialogue and information with no time to enjoy the puzzle. It might be better second time around, so I will watch on tv in a couple of months.In particular, Daniel Craig's southern gentleman detective is far too noisy, bumbling, and silly. Most of the other characters are almost clichés. The whole movie looks rushed into production, a desperate attempt to make up for losses during COVID.Too bad.

"Glass Onion (2022)","Slow start, exciting middle and childish end...","mazbutt-16041","Watching on the big screen, at its best this would be a solid 8+/10 movie, but there are a few areas that let it down.First is the excessive lockdown/mask/Zoom scenes at the start of the film. This was never good comedic or dramatic material in the first place, and has already aged badly.Second is a somewhat over-the-top finale which aims for spectacular but ends up a bit silly - and that isn't where a murder-mystery should be. Less is more.But the greatest problem is the decision to re-tell the whole story from a different perspective half-way through. After carefully building the tension so that darkness falls with a murderer on the loose... the audience is taken back to the start again. It completely ruins the momentum of the film. Granted, this does allow the reveal to be even more complicated, but it also greatly reduces the wow-factor of Benoit Blanc's deduction. The genius detective solving the case is the fulcrum of this kind of movie and shouldn't be diminished.Production values are high, and the supporting cast are good, although some have fairly slender roles. Kate Hudson is superb as Birdie.In conclusion, I'm pleased to see Blanc back. Daniel Craig brought more eccentricity to the character this time around, but I liked it. A modern-day Poirot.

It might be better second time around, so I will watch on tv in a couple of months.In particular, Daniel Craig's southern gentleman detective is far too noisy, bumbling, and silly.

But for me, this film was so over-the-top that I continually felt as though I were watching a TV sit-com or vaudeville show. That, not a film during which several central characters actually are murdered. And a murderer must be uncovered.By 'over-the-top' I mean this. (1) The acting was as broad as a slap-stick comedy. (2) The dialogue was not the least bit anchored in anything approaching reality. (3) The look of the film, the overdone brightness and color saturation of the production, made it almost an animated feature. And finally (4) there is the issue of Daniel Craig's dialect, which I have to say I found annoying. At best.A group of people are invited to a Greek Island on which a game will be played. But once there they learn that the game has already begun and that murder, or the prevention of it, is the game's objective. As with Agatha Christy mysteries, each invitee has a reason to murder someone, and with the group unable to depart the island, murder will no doubt take place. But - for the reasons outlined above - we (or 'I') did not care. On the positive side I enjoyed Kate Hudson as an aging beauty. As to the rest of the performances, the less said the better, but Edward Norton as the island's host stands out in terms of his being entirely miscast.I don't want to say more, for fear of giving too much away.So, that's it. If you're anything like my friends, you'll enjoy this piece of nonsense.But if you're anything like me, you'll cringe. And perhaps seek out some new friends.","23 December 2022","3/10",NA
"Glass Onion (2022)","It was written on a napkin","eve_dolluk","What happened?!I am so bitterly confused!I was looking forward to this film so much after Knives Out instantly becoming one of my all time favourites.Did I overhype it? Were my expectations too high? Did I watch the same film as the critics?By all means, I'm not saying this is a bad film but compared to the original, it misses rather hard. What an absolute let down.I have no complaints about the cast, the score, the cinematography, the direction etc. It's the writing. Did Rian Johnson just forget what sort of film he was writing or something? It certainly showed a lot of promise in the first act, it definitely had me intruiged. The middle act had it's moments of twists and revelations I suppose. But the last act - what happened? What a mess. There was no pay off. It was such an unsatisfying conclusion. Honestly, it felt like they may as well have just said; ""It was all a dream"". It was so much off the mark which really hurts.I'm glad to see that I guess a lot of people enjoyed it and maybe the next installment will be better. One can only hope.","31 December 2022","5/10",NA

The result? A BLAND and PREDICTABLE story from start till finish.Is it all bad? Nope. The acting performances are okay. Edward Norton is always fun to watch.

I was, however, disappointed.With Glass Onion, director and writer Rian Johnson shows once again that he can carefully craft an intriguing story with brilliant direction. But with a bigger budget comes many challenges and unfortunately the movie fails when it is trying too be too extravagant and a spectacle for the viewers.The core story is very interesting and after a dull start, the middle of the film really hits it's stride with Johnson moving his playing pieces about with ease and wonderment. That was when i most enjoyed the movie.But the ending was ultimately disappointing. Childish humour and some sequences that were clearly for spectacle which i can only describe as 'throwing a tantrum' ruined this movie for me.I had some fun with this but was left feeling robbed as there was definitely a compelling enough story here for this to be another great movie. I do feel the more intimate character/story driven moments in this film are where it shines and not in the big budget set pieces.Watch this if you enjoy the genre, but please lower your expectations before doing so!","7 January 2023","5/10",NA

"Glass Onion (2022)","Slow start, exciting middle and childish end...","mazbutt-16041","Watching on the big screen, at its best this would be a solid 8+/10 movie, but there are a few areas that let it down.First is the excessive lockdown/mask/Zoom scenes at the start of the film. This was never good comedic or dramatic material in the first place, and has already aged badly.Second is a somewhat over-the-top finale which aims for spectacular but ends up a bit silly - and that isn't where a murder-mystery should be. Less is more.But the greatest problem is the decision to re-tell the whole story from a different perspective half-way through. After carefully building the tension so that darkness falls with a murderer on the loose... the audience is taken back to the start again. It completely ruins the momentum of the film. Granted, this does allow the reveal to be even more complicated, but it also greatly reduces the wow-factor of Benoit Blanc's deduction. The genius detective solving the case is the fulcrum of this kind of movie and shouldn't be diminished.Production values are high, and the supporting cast are good, although some have fairly slender roles. Kate Hudson is superb as Birdie.In conclusion, I'm pleased to see Blanc back. Daniel Craig brought more eccentricity to the character this time around, but I liked it. A modern-day Poirot. I'd happily see a series of his adventures on the big screen. Just return to a more traditional murder-mystery structure (please).","6 January 2023","6/10",NA
"Glass Onion (2022)","not as good as its previous one","saru2020","I really wanted to like this, but the direction was lacklustre. When you have a very complicated plot, then editing, pacing and direction are critical. This is not nearly as much fun as the first Knives Out, and the dialogue is strained. The players try very hard, but it's all a jumble of dialogue and information with no time to enjoy the puzzle. It might be better second time around, so I will watch on tv in a couple of months.In particular, Daniel Craig's southern gentleman detective is far too noisy, bumbling, and silly. Most of the other characters are almost clichés. The whole movie looks rushed into production, a desperate attempt to make up for losses during COVID.Too bad. Perhaps a ""directors cut"" might be better.","26 November 2022","6/10",NA
"Glass Onion (2022)","Entertaining but loses momentum","davidallenxyz","Put an A-List cast in a film with bad writing, give them a poor director who elicits wooden acting, make the whole thing boring and predictable, then nominate this mess for a bunch of awards-and you have another clumsy, dull, ghastly product from the dying west. Beginning in the opening scene, this is one of the worst movies ever made, and the fact it still gets rave reviews here and nominations out there makes this decline complete. There are far better films and series coming from international filmmaking today. I miss great moviemaking from Hollywood-the classics going back over a hundred years. But we have forgotten how to make great movies, and audiences have forgotten what they even are. Good grief this is awful.","23 November 2022","7/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","tar","mossgrymk","It is not surprising that this film is tanking at the box office since it is much too long and slow paced for the average movie goer's attention span. Indeed parts of it, like the agonizingly protracted opening scene where a New Yorker magazine music critic interviews the title character about her classical music esthetics, seem designed by writer/director Tod Field as a boredom experiment wherein if you can survive it without running and screaming into the night out of sheer and utter ennui then you are worthy to see the rest of his ""masterpiece"".Thing is, though, that a lot of this film does approach, if not encroach upon, masterpiece territory. Certain scenes, like Lydia Tar's bleak Staten Island homecoming where she summons the spirit of her mentor Leonard Bernstein in an effort to recapture the humanistic values she has lost, are genuinely heartbreaking. And the sequences that deal with Lydia's manipulation of her acolytes are difficult to watch as we see how artistic power feels even more corruptible, somehow, than the political kind, perhaps because it is a profanation of a purer space.And I think we can all agree that Cate Blanchett is one helluva fine actor! As are Nina Hoss, Noemie Merlant and Sophie Kauer who play various of her entourage/victims.Bottom line: For all its faults I have a sneaking suspicion that in twenty years they'll be watching this and not ""The Fabelmans"". Give it a B plus.","25 October 2022","8/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","All Hail Queen Blanchett","evanston_dad","Initially I was put off by Tár-it's cryptic, drab, and sluggish. Until I realized what the filmmakers were actually accomplishing. No spoilers in this review, but to enjoy the film you have to know certain things:1. Yes, Cate Blanchett is fantastic and rightfully deserves the accolades.2. The film is the slowest of slow burns.3. The film does not hold your hand.4. The film's narrative cuts out key elements of scenes that other filmmakers would have highlighted. This was the sticking point for me-it didn't dawn on me until halfway through the film what was happening. If you know this going in, I believe you'll have a better experience with the film. The film purposefully *doesn't* show you the ""important"" elements of scenes or relationships between characters. You have to figure that out yourself, just like putting together the puzzle of who Lydia Tár actually is. Here's a quick non-related example:Bill stared at the smoke in the frying pan.Bill rubbed his nose five times and took a call from Ernest while sipping coffee at Station 271.If those two sentences above were in a book, it would be leaving out major plot points that other authors would have filled in. First, there was a fire in Bill's kitchen. He called the fire department. He had to evacuate, so the fire may have been bad. And who is Ernest, if we have not been introduced to that character before? Why is bill rubbing his nose so much? Is it a tick or OCD or nervous habit?That's what Tár is like. It presents to you all the items ""between the lines"" and lets you solve for X for yourself. Once I understood that that was the dominant cinematic approach in this film, it became immensely more enjoyable...and challenging. Very much worth your time if you put in the effort.","27 February 2023","9/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","It's absolutely brilliant ONCE you know how the film ""works.""","Daviteo","Tár is a dense film. Thick with dialogue and emotional power. It's also a bit tricky to get in to and might be a bit much for the casual viewer. That's a shame though as it's great. Lydia Tár (Cate Blanchett) is a renowned concert conductor. An opening montage leads us into a live interview with the New Yorker, introducing her achievements to date. Let's just say it's a stellar CV. Right from the off, Tár is a force. Confident and assertive, but there are hints of the smallest of cracks. People will often misunderstand the role of a conductor, reducing it to something almost needless. Director and writer Todd Field knows this and lets that opening interview roll, as a device it not only introduces us to Tár, but the world of classical orchestration and her interpretation of it. Like I said, dense. At the top of her game, there's plenty of admirers, both publicly and professionally. Like Elliot Kaplan (Mark Strong) with a fantastic wig, who's told ""There's no glory for a robot, do your own thing"". Or a room full of nervous students at Juilliard, who also feel the wrath of Tár's uncompromising views. She's putting a lot of herself out there, is she as certain of herself as she appears though and when everything appears so perfect and controlled, what aren't we seeing. Those potential cracks show themselves through Francesca (Noémie Merlant), she's the assistant. Seemingly subordinate, she's clearly privy to some weakness, could be the weakness, or quite the opposite. Tár's partner Sharon (Nina Hoss) too. She has a fragility and brings out a tenderness in Tár, but there's something else. It's clear that Tár intends on retaining her position, status, power. Ruthlessly if required. These personal moments though really help the flow of this film. Although slightly bleak, they're a breath of fresh air in Tár's austere world. It's a beautiful world though. Rooms vast with modernist lines and understated grandeur. I find myself lost in these spaces as Tár too begins to ebb. I can imagine that classical music students might lap the opening acts up, it feels important. Is it though, or is it an impenetrable pretentious three hour indulgence. I'd say it's neither. It's a slow burning drama. That doesn't so much as unfold as gently slides into a darkness as Tár's facade crumbles. Accelerated by the arrival Olga (Sophie Kauer) a no nonsense Russian cellist, brought in to help a live performance recording of Mahler's Symphony No.5... but is anything but a stabilising presence. It demands your attention. Blanchett is incredible. It's an explosive performance. Utterly captivating. A singular pivotal presence. ""It's not a democracy"". She needs to be too. At not far off 3 hours, it's an intense experience. Be prepared to be patient, but you will be rewarded.","20 October 2022","8/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","the right note ... for a specific audience","ferguson-6","Everybody writing about this mock biopic focuses on Cate Blanchett's knock-it-out-of-the-park performance, but when compared to Field's ""Little Children"" (2006), ""Tár"" lacks the storytelling and editing skills which make the earlier film a masterpiece of human relations, whereas the latter is an interesting character study that somehow collapses under its own weight.There's a strong establishing scene showing Tár demolishing an aspiring musician's conceited views on Bach, yet one has to wait for a long time for a follow-up showing the main character's boundary issues. The central topic emerges rather quickly (abuse of power), but there are diversions which support character development, yet drag on the narrative, which is probably why many reviews here find the film frustrating.Being an ex-Berliner, I like the fact that the city is being used as a real location as opposed to the usual tourist / Cold War hot spots, and the Philharmonics rehearsal scenes are very well done, but they don't really push the story forward and could have easily been wound down a bit.Nina Hoss as Tár's partner is a brilliant counterpoint, because she keeps a good deal of her thoughts to herself until she doesn't, so more focus on their relationship would have helped the story. Hoss would deserve a supporting actress Academy Award nod if only she had more screen time.The initial scene of conflict eventually loops back into focus, and Field could have used this to explore societal misjudgment as he did in ""Little Children"" - but he doesn't, which makes ""Tár"" rather distant and cold. Field expects viewers to interpret a lot on their own, which is bold and demanding, but with this approach it is crucial to keep focus on an underlying message, otherwise it gets lost.In conclusion, ""Tár"" has all the ingredients for a masterpiece - interesting characters, great performances, nice camerawork - but weak storytelling ultimately reduces the film's potential.","1 February 2023","8/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","Powerful stuff. Blanchett is incredible.","garethcrook","How much you enjoy Tar will depend largely on how you feel about a film that begins with the credits. There's good reason for it (everything in Tar is considered down to the smallest detail) but if you can't get on board with that kind of self indulgence then you are in for a long two and a half hours.One of the reasons for beginning with the credits may be that we are about witness a career in reverse. An opening interview lets us know that Lydia Tar is at the top of her profession, a conductor with a dream resume and an EGOT who is about to complete her masterpiece symphony recording. Over the next couple of hours we see her slipping down the mountain as past deeds and the way she treats people in general come back to take a bite out of her perfect life.The film solely follows Kate Blanchett's Tar for the entire runtime, we see all events from her perspective and she is in every scene. Blanchett put its an astounding performance, indeed it is hard to imagine many, if any, other actors who could have been up to the task. That the whole show rests on such a powerful but subtle turn is Tar's greatest strength but also its only real weakness. Its a nuanced performance that fits perfectly but added to the characters flawed nature it can at times leave proceedings feeling cold and hard to connect with emotionally. Like its titular character Tar is a film of craftmanship and intellect not emotion, although the themes of hierarchy dynamics and abuse are powerful.If you can get on board with the full force filmaking style then you will find Tar a breathtaking wonder of a movie with something to think about in every scene and something to ponder long after the (second lot of) credits roll.9 successful recordings out of 10 symphonies.","4 December 2022","7/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","great performances, weak storytelling","Radu_A","I watched Tár over the course of a few hours, frequently pausing the film and watching something else, then coming back to it. Or taking a nap. I don't think calling this movie boring is that controversial; the first 40 minutes of the film are deliberately difficult, an excruciatingly long interview opens the film and it's follow quickly by a dinner conversation that goes on for way too long.To say Tár did not need to be 2 hrs and 37 minutes long would be beating a dead horse. Of course it didn't need to be. It is beause it reflects the sort of pretentious, grandiose person Lydia Tár is. Tár, at its core, is a character study and a parable about modern times; a film about cancel culture and the accountability of cultural icons.Cate Blanchett truly disappears into this role and delivers a powerhouse performance here. It's hard not to sound like a broken record, but she really becomes Lydia. There's an amazing physicality to her performance along with her incredible affectations and ability to portray Tár consistently, even whilst speaking different languages.I also found the film's sometimes meandering pace to be compelling as it gave us a chance to get to know people without necessarily figuring out where they all fit in Tár's life. It really made the film feel like a slice of life, where the story has a lot of context before the movie begins, and will go on after (naturally, given the ending).It's also a very well made film; the cinematography and sound design, thankfully, are impeccable. You really get sucked into whatever room you're in and there's an overbearing sense of atmosphere, a coldness associated with the refined world of classical music.Yet, this is also a movie I'd probably never watch again. It does a lot quite well, but is too simple a plot to waste so much time. Most of the other um...non, Tár characters, are pretty paper thin and we don't really have any particular subplots or complex relationship dynamics. As the movie lurches towards its end, I felt like it implies a strong emotional connection to what's happening, but it never really made it.This is a story that could've been told in a very conventional, straightforward way, but it's smarter than that. It takes a pretty nuanced and difficult-to-discuss subject and tackles it head on, but in a way that feels as if it's an aspect of the character's life and not the whole thing. Tár, like many Oscar bait films, has a lot to appreciate. But, I genuinely don't believe it's the sort of film many people will honestly remember and appreciate years down the road.","1 February 2023","6/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","Tar de Force","danchilton-71955","Director Todd Field is undeniably up to something different with his new film 'Tar'. Though what it is he's actually up to, what his goal is, I couldn't say. One thing for sure, It's strange. Very. And another thing for sure, it don't work.Proof?The first seven minutes are dedicated to scrolling the film's credits. No, not credits for Kate Blanchette and the rest of the cast. I'm talking about Key Grip, Best Boy, Stunt Man #1: the stuff you normally see at a film's conclusion: if you stick around for the credits.The film's next fifteen minutes feature a one on one interview between the film's protagonist Ms. Tar (Blanchette) and New Yorker Columnist Adam Gopnik (playing himself). The two are seated on an auditorium's stage, the audience silent, Ms. Blanchette / Tar fiercely intense as the Philharmonic Conductor describes her craft. This goes on far longer than you expect. And, in my opinion, far longer than necessary.The next segment is a lunch or dinner at which Ms. Tar and an associate (Who is he? I don't know. But I should.) discuss the politics and interpersonal relationships going on in Ms. Tar's Orchestra: The Berlin Philharmonic. The viewer is a fly on the wall to this gossip. We have to listen closely because much is mumbled. But never mind: the people gossiped about are people we don't know (yet) and so we - as in 'I' - tune out (perhaps a mistake but I could not help it). There are innuendoes a'plenty here; we learn that Ms. Tar is a lesbian and the man sitting across from her might be, or might once have been, attracted to men.Here, at about the thirty to forty minute mark, I considered leaving. But I didn't. You, however, may give in to the inclination to draw fresh air and frankly I would not blame you. But if you do consider leaving, let me tell you this:1. The rest of the film moves at a faster pace. Much faster. In fact the longer it goes, the faster the pace.2. Ms. Blanchette is, in fact, as fabulous as you've undoubtedly read. If you do stay, stay for her performance, not the story.3. The gossip you overheard at that lunch / dinner table? As the film progresses it will begin to make sense to you. Completely? No. But somewhat.4. Conductor Tar is a mighty presence with an 'Achilles Heel'. And that weakness has gotten her into a bit of trouble. But exactly what it is she did - I mean exactly - remains somehow vague. We never doubt her weaknesses, but would probably benefit from some more detail. Such as, What was her relationship to the person who got Tar into trouble. Was the person a student? A member of the symphony?5. The scenes of Blanchette / Tar conducting the orchestra are fine. They are not jaw-droppingly sensational (as other critics would have you believe). In short, I was. Disappointed.The way I see it, if you're reading this review it's likely you've already decided to see it. And if that's the case I hope this will assist you in adjusting your expectations. 'Adjusting', as in lowering.","19 October 2022","9/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","Cate should be nominated for an Oscar; it's that good.","JohnDeSando","During the first minute of this film, Cate Blanchett shows what an extraordinary actress she is. Her character, star conductor Lydia Tár, is waiting to go onstage. There is no dialogue, only body language. But even without words, Blanchett shows what Tár thinks and feels.Blanchett's remarkable performance is a large part of what makes this a good movie. But there's more. The very clever script gives us a lot to chew on afterards. Tár is a woman in the men-dominated world of classical music. She's not warm, empathic or even very sympathetic. In fact, she has many characteristics that are usually associated with men. She's vain, selfish and manipulative. And that's what gets her in trouble. At the start of the film, she seems to be one of the most admired women in the world. She is extremely famous and successful. At the end, everything has fallen apart.The film doesn't judge. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide if Lydia Tár is a victim or a culprit. Or maybe both at the same time. The viewer gets a lot of information to make up his (or her) mind. Director Todd Field gives us the story elements slowly, bit by bit. Take the scene where Lydia Tár gives a stern speech to a young girl who bullies her daughter. It shows that she is used to getting everyone in line, according to her wishes. That's useful information to interpret things later on in the movie.Tár is very much a modern movie. It has things to say about gender, about power, about social media, about being woke. But at the same time, it's a very old-fashioned movie. It takes its time. There are long scenes, and long takes. There's nothing modern in the way it is filmed. And that's a good thing.","6 November 2023","7/10",NA

Seemingly subordinate, she's clearly privy to some weakness, could be the weakness, or quite the opposite. Tár's partner Sharon (Nina Hoss) too. She has a fragility and brings out a tenderness in Tár, but there's something else. It's clear that Tár intends on retaining her position, status, power. Ruthlessly if required. These personal moments though really help the flow of this film. Although slightly bleak, they're a breath of fresh air in Tár's austere world. It's a beautiful world though. Rooms vast with modernist lines and understated grandeur. I find myself lost in these spaces as Tár too begins to ebb. I can imagine that classical music students might lap the opening acts up, it feels important. Is it though, or is it an impenetrable pretentious three hour indulgence. I'd say it's neither. It's a slow burning drama. That doesn't so much as unfold as gently slides into a darkness as Tár's facade crumbles. Accelerated by the arrival Olga (Sophie Kauer) a no nonsense Russian cellist, brought in to help a live performance recording of Mahler's Symphony No.5... but is anything but a stabilising presence. It demands your attention. Blanchett is incredible. It's an explosive performance. Utterly captivating. A singular pivotal presence. ""It's not a democracy"". She needs to be too. At not far off 3 hours, it's an intense experience. Be prepared to be patient, but you will be rewarded.","20 October 2022","8/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","the right note ... for a specific audience","ferguson-6","Everybody writing about this mock biopic focuses on Cate Blanchett's knock-it-out-of-the-park performance, but when compared to Field's ""Little Children"" (2006), ""Tár"" lacks the storytelling and editing skills which make the earlier film a masterpiece of human relations, whereas the latter is an interesting character study that somehow collapses under its own weight.There's a strong establishing scene showing Tár demolishing an aspiring musician's conceited views on Bach, yet one has to wait for a long time for a follow-up showing the main character's boundary issues. The central topic emerges rather quickly (abuse of power), but there are diversions which support character development, yet drag on the narrative, which is probably why many reviews here find the film frustrating.Being an ex-Berliner, I like the fact that the city is being used as a real location as opposed to the usual tourist / Cold War hot spots, and the Philharmonics rehearsal scenes are very well done, but they don't really push the story forward and could have easily been wound down a bit.Nina Hoss as Tár's partner is a brilliant counterpoint, because she keeps a good deal of her thoughts to herself until she doesn't, so more focus on their relationship would have helped the story. Hoss would deserve a supporting actress Academy Award nod if only she had more screen time.The initial scene of conflict eventually loops back into focus, and Field could have used this to explore societal misjudgment as he did in ""Little Children"" - but he doesn't, which makes ""Tár"" rather distant and cold. Field expects viewers to interpret a lot on their own, which is bold and demanding, but with this approach it is crucial to keep focus on an underlying message, otherwise it gets lost.In conclusion, ""Tár"" has all the ingredients for a masterpiece - interesting characters, great performances, nice camerawork - but weak storytelling ultimately reduces the film's potential.","1 February 2023","8/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","Powerful stuff. Blanchett is incredible.","garethcrook","How much you enjoy Tar will depend largely on how you feel about a film that begins with the credits. There's good reason for it (everything in Tar is considered down to the smallest detail) but if you can't get on board with that kind of self indulgence then you are in for a long two and a half hours.One of the reasons for beginning with the credits may be that we are about witness a career in reverse. An opening interview lets us know that Lydia Tar is at the top of her profession, a conductor with a dream resume and an EGOT who is about to complete her masterpiece symphony recording. Over the next couple of hours we see her slipping down the mountain as past deeds and the way she treats people in general come back to take a bite out of her perfect life.The film solely follows Kate Blanchett's Tar for the entire runtime, we see all events from her perspective and she is in every scene. Blanchett put its an astounding performance, indeed it is hard to imagine many, if any, other actors who could have been up to the task. That the whole show rests on such a powerful but subtle turn is Tar's greatest strength but also its only real weakness. Its a nuanced performance that fits perfectly but added to the characters flawed nature it can at times leave proceedings feeling cold and hard to connect with emotionally. Like its titular character Tar is a film of craftmanship and intellect not emotion, although the themes of hierarchy dynamics and abuse are powerful.If you can get on board with the full force filmaking style then you will find Tar a breathtaking wonder of a movie with something to think about in every scene and something to ponder long after the (second lot of) credits roll.9 successful recordings out of 10 symphonies.","4 December 2022","7/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","great performances, weak storytelling","Radu_A","I watched Tár over the course of a few hours, frequently pausing the film and watching something else, then coming back to it. Or taking a nap. I don't think calling this movie boring is that controversial; the first 40 minutes of the film are deliberately difficult, an excruciatingly long interview opens the film and it's follow quickly by a dinner conversation that goes on for way too long.To say Tár did not need to be 2 hrs and 37 minutes long would be beating a dead horse. Of course it didn't need to be. It is beause it reflects the sort of pretentious, grandiose person Lydia Tár is. Tár, at its core, is a character study and a parable about modern times; a film about cancel culture and the accountability of cultural icons.Cate Blanchett truly disappears into this role and delivers a powerhouse performance here. It's hard not to sound like a broken record, but she really becomes Lydia. There's an amazing physicality to her performance along with her incredible affectations and ability to portray Tár consistently, even whilst speaking different languages.I also found the film's sometimes meandering pace to be compelling as it gave us a chance to get to know people without necessarily figuring out where they all fit in Tár's life. It really made the film feel like a slice of life, where the story has a lot of context before the movie begins, and will go on after (naturally, given the ending).It's also a very well made film; the cinematography and sound design, thankfully, are impeccable. You really get sucked into whatever room you're in and there's an overbearing sense of atmosphere, a coldness associated with the refined world of classical music.Yet, this is also a movie I'd probably never watch again. It does a lot quite well, but is too simple a plot to waste so much time. Most of the other um...non, Tár characters, are pretty paper thin and we don't really have any particular subplots or complex relationship dynamics. As the movie lurches towards its end, I felt like it implies a strong emotional connection to what's happening, but it never really made it.This is a story that could've been told in a very conventional, straightforward way, but it's smarter than that. It takes a pretty nuanced and difficult-to-discuss subject and tackles it head on, but in a way that feels as if it's an aspect of the character's life and not the whole thing. Tár, like many Oscar bait films, has a lot to appreciate. But, I genuinely don't believe it's the sort of film many people will honestly remember and appreciate years down the road.","1 February 2023","6/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","Tar de Force","danchilton-71955","Director Todd Field is undeniably up to something different with his new film 'Tar'. Though what it is he's actually up to, what his goal is, I couldn't say. One thing for sure, It's strange. Very. And another thing for sure, it don't work.Proof?The first seven minutes are dedicated to scrolling the film's credits. No, not credits for Kate Blanchette and the rest of the cast. I'm talking about Key Grip, Best Boy, Stunt Man #1: the stuff you normally see at a film's conclusion: if you stick around for the credits.The film's next fifteen minutes feature a one on one interview between the film's protagonist Ms. Tar (Blanchette) and New Yorker Columnist Adam Gopnik (playing himself). The two are seated on an auditorium's stage, the audience silent, Ms. Blanchette / Tar fiercely intense as the Philharmonic Conductor describes her craft. This goes on far longer than you expect. And, in my opinion, far longer than necessary.The next segment is a lunch or dinner at which Ms. Tar and an associate (Who is he? I don't know. But I should.) discuss the politics and interpersonal relationships going on in Ms. Tar's Orchestra: The Berlin Philharmonic. The viewer is a fly on the wall to this gossip. We have to listen closely because much is mumbled. But never mind: the people gossiped about are people we don't know (yet) and so we - as in 'I' - tune out (perhaps a mistake but I could not help it). There are innuendoes a'plenty here; we learn that Ms. Tar is a lesbian and the man sitting across from her might be, or might once have been, attracted to men.Here, at about the thirty to forty minute mark, I considered leaving. But I didn't. You, however, may give in to the inclination to draw fresh air and frankly I would not blame you. But if you do consider leaving, let me tell you this:1. The rest of the film moves at a faster pace. Much faster. In fact the longer it goes, the faster the pace.2. Ms. Blanchette is, in fact, as fabulous as you've undoubtedly read. If you do stay, stay for her performance, not the story.3. The gossip you overheard at that lunch / dinner table? As the film progresses it will begin to make sense to you. Completely? No. But somewhat.4. Conductor Tar is a mighty presence with an 'Achilles Heel'. And that weakness has gotten her into a bit of trouble. But exactly what it is she did - I mean exactly - remains somehow vague. We never doubt her weaknesses, but would probably benefit from some more detail. Such as, What was her relationship to the person who got Tar into trouble. Was the person a student? A member of the symphony?5. The scenes of Blanchette / Tar conducting the orchestra are fine. They are not jaw-droppingly sensational (as other critics would have you believe). In short, I was. Disappointed.The way I see it, if you're reading this review it's likely you've already decided to see it. And if that's the case I hope this will assist you in adjusting your expectations. 'Adjusting', as in lowering.","19 October 2022","9/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","Cate should be nominated for an Oscar; it's that good.","JohnDeSando","During the first minute of this film, Cate Blanchett shows what an extraordinary actress she is. Her character, star conductor Lydia Tár, is waiting to go onstage. There is no dialogue, only body language. But even without words, Blanchett shows what Tár thinks and feels.Blanchett's remarkable performance is a large part of what makes this a good movie. But there's more. The very clever script gives us a lot to chew on afterards. Tár is a woman in the men-dominated world of classical music. She's not warm, empathic or even very sympathetic. In fact, she has many characteristics that are usually associated with men. She's vain, selfish and manipulative. And that's what gets her in trouble. At the start of the film, she seems to be one of the most admired women in the world. She is extremely famous and successful. At the end, everything has fallen apart.The film doesn't judge. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide if Lydia Tár is a victim or a culprit. Or maybe both at the same time. The viewer gets a lot of information to make up his (or her) mind. Director Todd Field gives us the story elements slowly, bit by bit. Take the scene where Lydia Tár gives a stern speech to a young girl who bullies her daughter. It shows that she is used to getting everyone in line, according to her wishes. That's useful information to interpret things later on in the movie.Tár is very much a modern movie. It has things to say about gender, about power, about social media, about being woke. But at the same time, it's a very old-fashioned movie. It takes its time. There are long scenes, and long takes. There's nothing modern in the way it is filmed. And that's a good thing.","6 November 2023","7/10",NA

I hate that. But perhaps some others wont mind this at all.More bad: there is more troubling with this movie.

"Tár (2022)","How can a first hour seem like a year?","levybob","Near perfection from Blanchett. It's a steamy, slow burn with a massive payoff, even at 150+ minutes. Cate Blanchett's range of emotions exhibited through her acting is superb. The closeup orchestra rehearsal scenes are extraordinarily insightful for those who maybe have never been a part of a performing ensemble.Synopsis:
Tár (stylized in all caps) is a 2022 psychological drama film written and directed by Todd Field and starring Cate Blanchett.

"Tár (2022)","tar","mossgrymk","It is not surprising that this film is tanking at the box office since it is much too long and slow paced for the average movie goer's attention span. Indeed parts of it, like the agonizingly protracted opening scene where a New Yorker magazine music critic interviews the title character about her classical music esthetics, seem designed by writer/director Tod Field as a boredom experiment wherein if you can survive it without running and screaming into the night out of sheer and utter ennui then you are worthy to see the rest of his ""masterpiece"".Thing is, though, that a lot of this film does approach, if not encroach upon, masterpiece territory. Certain scenes, like Lydia Tar's bleak Staten Island homecoming where she summons the spirit of her mentor Leonard Bernstein in an effort to recapture the humanistic values she has lost, are genuinely heartbreaking. And the sequences that deal with Lydia's manipulation of her acolytes are difficult to watch as we see how artistic power feels even more corruptible, somehow, than the political kind, perhaps because it is a profanation of a purer space.And I think we can all agree that Cate Blanchett is one helluva fine actor! As are Nina Hoss, Noemie Merlant and Sophie Kauer who play various of her entourage/victims.Bottom line: For all its faults I have a sneaking suspicion that in twenty years they'll be watching this and not ""The Fabelmans"". Give it a B plus.","25 October 2022","8/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","All Hail Queen Blanchett","evanston_dad","Initially I was put off by Tár-it's cryptic, drab, and sluggish. Until I realized what the filmmakers were actually accomplishing. No spoilers in this review, but to enjoy the film you have to know certain things:1. Yes, Cate Blanchett is fantastic and rightfully deserves the accolades.2. The film is the slowest of slow burns.3. The film does not hold your hand.4. The film's narrative cuts out key elements of scenes that other filmmakers would have highlighted. This was the sticking point for me-it didn't dawn on me until halfway through the film what was happening. If you know this going in, I believe you'll have a better experience with the film. The film purposefully *doesn't* show you the ""important"" elements of scenes or relationships between characters. You have to figure that out yourself, just like putting together the puzzle of who Lydia Tár actually is. Here's a quick non-related example:Bill stared at the smoke in the frying pan.Bill rubbed his nose five times and took a call from Ernest while sipping coffee at Station 271.If those two sentences above were in a book, it would be leaving out major plot points that other authors would have filled in. First, there was a fire in Bill's kitchen. He called the fire department. He had to evacuate, so the fire may have been bad. And who is Ernest, if we have not been introduced to that character before? Why is bill rubbing his nose so much? Is it a tick or OCD or nervous habit?That's what Tár is like. It presents to you all the items ""between the lines"" and lets you solve for X for yourself. Once I understood that that was the dominant cinematic approach in this film, it became immensely more enjoyable...and challenging. Very much worth your time if you put in the effort.","27 February 2023","9/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","It's absolutely brilliant ONCE you know how the film ""works.""","Daviteo","Tár is a dense film. Thick with dialogue and emotional power. It's also a bit tricky to get in to and might be a bit much for the casual viewer. That's a shame though as it's great. Lydia Tár (Cate Blanchett) is a renowned concert conductor. An opening montage leads us into a live interview with the New Yorker, introducing her achievements to date. Let's just say it's a stellar CV. Right from the off, Tár is a force. Confident and assertive, but there are hints of the smallest of cracks. People will often misunderstand the role of a conductor, reducing it to something almost needless. Director and writer Todd Field knows this and lets that opening interview roll, as a device it not only introduces us to Tár, but the world of classical orchestration and her interpretation of it. Like I said, dense. At the top of her game, there's plenty of admirers, both publicly and professionally. Like Elliot Kaplan (Mark Strong) with a fantastic wig, who's told ""There's no glory for a robot, do your own thing"". Or a room full of nervous students at Juilliard, who also feel the wrath of Tár's uncompromising views. She's putting a lot of herself out there, is she as certain of herself as she appears though and when everything appears so perfect and controlled, what aren't we seeing. Those potential cracks show themselves through Francesca (Noémie Merlant), she's the assistant. Seemingly subordinate, she's clearly privy to some weakness, could be the weakness, or quite the opposite. Tár's partner Sharon (Nina Hoss) too.

"Tár (2022)","How can a first hour seem like a year?","levybob","Near perfection from Blanchett. It's a steamy, slow burn with a massive payoff, even at 150+ minutes.

Tár (stylized in all caps) is a 2022 psychological drama film written and directed by Todd Field and starring Cate Blanchett. Blanchett plays Lydia Tár, a renowned celebrity conductor who is embroiled in a career-ending scandal over accusations of serial sexual harassment and abuse.","4 March 2023","4/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","tar","mossgrymk","It is not surprising that this film is tanking at the box office since it is much too long and slow paced for the average movie goer's attention span. Indeed parts of it, like the agonizingly protracted opening scene where a New Yorker magazine music critic interviews the title character about her classical music esthetics, seem designed by writer/director Tod Field as a boredom experiment wherein if you can survive it without running and screaming into the night out of sheer and utter ennui then you are worthy to see the rest of his ""masterpiece"".Thing is, though, that a lot of this film does approach, if not encroach upon, masterpiece territory. Certain scenes, like Lydia Tar's bleak Staten Island homecoming where she summons the spirit of her mentor Leonard Bernstein in an effort to recapture the humanistic values she has lost, are genuinely heartbreaking. And the sequences that deal with Lydia's manipulation of her acolytes are difficult to watch as we see how artistic power feels even more corruptible, somehow, than the political kind, perhaps because it is a profanation of a purer space.And I think we can all agree that Cate Blanchett is one helluva fine actor! As are Nina Hoss, Noemie Merlant and Sophie Kauer who play various of her entourage/victims.Bottom line: For all its faults I have a sneaking suspicion that in twenty years they'll be watching this and not ""The Fabelmans"". Give it a B plus.","25 October 2022","8/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","All Hail Queen Blanchett","evanston_dad","Initially I was put off by Tár-it's cryptic, drab, and sluggish. Until I realized what the filmmakers were actually accomplishing. No spoilers in this review, but to enjoy the film you have to know certain things:1. Yes, Cate Blanchett is fantastic and rightfully deserves the accolades.2. The film is the slowest of slow burns.3. The film does not hold your hand.4. The film's narrative cuts out key elements of scenes that other filmmakers would have highlighted. This was the sticking point for me-it didn't dawn on me until halfway through the film what was happening. If you know this going in, I believe you'll have a better experience with the film. The film purposefully *doesn't* show you the ""important"" elements of scenes or relationships between characters. You have to figure that out yourself, just like putting together the puzzle of who Lydia Tár actually is. Here's a quick non-related example:Bill stared at the smoke in the frying pan.Bill rubbed his nose five times and took a call from Ernest while sipping coffee at Station 271.If those two sentences above were in a book, it would be leaving out major plot points that other authors would have filled in. First, there was a fire in Bill's kitchen. He called the fire department. He had to evacuate, so the fire may have been bad. And who is Ernest, if we have not been introduced to that character before? Why is bill rubbing his nose so much? Is it a tick or OCD or nervous habit?That's what Tár is like. It presents to you all the items ""between the lines"" and lets you solve for X for yourself. Once I understood that that was the dominant cinematic approach in this film, it became immensely more enjoyable...and challenging. Very much worth your time if you put in the effort.","27 February 2023","9/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","It's absolutely brilliant ONCE you know how the film ""works.""","Daviteo","Tár is a dense film. Thick with dialogue and emotional power. It's also a bit tricky to get in to and might be a bit much for the casual viewer. That's a shame though as it's great. Lydia Tár (Cate Blanchett) is a renowned concert conductor. An opening montage leads us into a live interview with the New Yorker, introducing her achievements to date. Let's just say it's a stellar CV. Right from the off, Tár is a force. Confident and assertive, but there are hints of the smallest of cracks. People will often misunderstand the role of a conductor, reducing it to something almost needless. Director and writer Todd Field knows this and lets that opening interview roll, as a device it not only introduces us to Tár, but the world of classical orchestration and her interpretation of it. Like I said, dense. At the top of her game, there's plenty of admirers, both publicly and professionally. Like Elliot Kaplan (Mark Strong) with a fantastic wig, who's told ""There's no glory for a robot, do your own thing"". Or a room full of nervous students at Juilliard, who also feel the wrath of Tár's uncompromising views. She's putting a lot of herself out there, is she as certain of herself as she appears though and when everything appears so perfect and controlled, what aren't we seeing. Those potential cracks show themselves through Francesca (Noémie Merlant), she's the assistant. Seemingly subordinate, she's clearly privy to some weakness, could be the weakness, or quite the opposite. Tár's partner Sharon (Nina Hoss) too. She has a fragility and brings out a tenderness in Tár, but there's something else. It's clear that Tár intends on retaining her position, status, power. Ruthlessly if required. These personal moments though really help the flow of this film. Although slightly bleak, they're a breath of fresh air in Tár's austere world. It's a beautiful world though. Rooms vast with modernist lines and understated grandeur. I find myself lost in these spaces as Tár too begins to ebb. I can imagine that classical music students might lap the opening acts up, it feels important. Is it though, or is it an impenetrable pretentious three hour indulgence. I'd say it's neither. It's a slow burning drama. That doesn't so much as unfold as gently slides into a darkness as Tár's facade crumbles. Accelerated by the arrival Olga (Sophie Kauer) a no nonsense Russian cellist, brought in to help a live performance recording of Mahler's Symphony No.5... but is anything but a stabilising presence. It demands your attention. Blanchett is incredible. It's an explosive performance. Utterly captivating. A singular pivotal presence. ""It's not a democracy"". She needs to be too. At not far off 3 hours, it's an intense experience. Be prepared to be patient, but you will be rewarded.","20 October 2022","8/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","the right note ... for a specific audience","ferguson-6","Everybody writing about this mock biopic focuses on Cate Blanchett's knock-it-out-of-the-park performance, but when compared to Field's ""Little Children"" (2006), ""Tár"" lacks the storytelling and editing skills which make the earlier film a masterpiece of human relations, whereas the latter is an interesting character study that somehow collapses under its own weight.There's a strong establishing scene showing Tár demolishing an aspiring musician's conceited views on Bach, yet one has to wait for a long time for a follow-up showing the main character's boundary issues. The central topic emerges rather quickly (abuse of power), but there are diversions which support character development, yet drag on the narrative, which is probably why many reviews here find the film frustrating.Being an ex-Berliner, I like the fact that the city is being used as a real location as opposed to the usual tourist / Cold War hot spots, and the Philharmonics rehearsal scenes are very well done, but they don't really push the story forward and could have easily been wound down a bit.Nina Hoss as Tár's partner is a brilliant counterpoint, because she keeps a good deal of her thoughts to herself until she doesn't, so more focus on their relationship would have helped the story. Hoss would deserve a supporting actress Academy Award nod if only she had more screen time.The initial scene of conflict eventually loops back into focus, and Field could have used this to explore societal misjudgment as he did in ""Little Children"" - but he doesn't, which makes ""Tár"" rather distant and cold. Field expects viewers to interpret a lot on their own, which is bold and demanding, but with this approach it is crucial to keep focus on an underlying message, otherwise it gets lost.In conclusion, ""Tár"" has all the ingredients for a masterpiece - interesting characters, great performances, nice camerawork - but weak storytelling ultimately reduces the film's potential.","1 February 2023","8/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","Powerful stuff. Blanchett is incredible.","garethcrook","How much you enjoy Tar will depend largely on how you feel about a film that begins with the credits. There's good reason for it (everything in Tar is considered down to the smallest detail) but if you can't get on board with that kind of self indulgence then you are in for a long two and a half hours.One of the reasons for beginning with the credits may be that we are about witness a career in reverse. An opening interview lets us know that Lydia Tar is at the top of her profession, a conductor with a dream resume and an EGOT who is about to complete her masterpiece symphony recording. Over the next couple of hours we see her slipping down the mountain as past deeds and the way she treats people in general come back to take a bite out of her perfect life.The film solely follows Kate Blanchett's Tar for the entire runtime, we see all events from her perspective and she is in every scene. Blanchett put its an astounding performance, indeed it is hard to imagine many, if any, other actors who could have been up to the task. That the whole show rests on such a powerful but subtle turn is Tar's greatest strength but also its only real weakness. Its a nuanced performance that fits perfectly but added to the characters flawed nature it can at times leave proceedings feeling cold and hard to connect with emotionally. Like its titular character Tar is a film of craftmanship and intellect not emotion, although the themes of hierarchy dynamics and abuse are powerful.If you can get on board with the full force filmaking style then you will find Tar a breathtaking wonder of a movie with something to think about in every scene and something to ponder long after the (second lot of) credits roll.9 successful recordings out of 10 symphonies.","4 December 2022","7/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","great performances, weak storytelling","Radu_A","I watched Tár over the course of a few hours, frequently pausing the film and watching something else, then coming back to it. Or taking a nap. I don't think calling this movie boring is that controversial; the first 40 minutes of the film are deliberately difficult, an excruciatingly long interview opens the film and it's follow quickly by a dinner conversation that goes on for way too long.To say Tár did not need to be 2 hrs and 37 minutes long would be beating a dead horse. Of course it didn't need to be. It is beause it reflects the sort of pretentious, grandiose person Lydia Tár is. Tár, at its core, is a character study and a parable about modern times; a film about cancel culture and the accountability of cultural icons.Cate Blanchett truly disappears into this role and delivers a powerhouse performance here. It's hard not to sound like a broken record, but she really becomes Lydia. There's an amazing physicality to her performance along with her incredible affectations and ability to portray Tár consistently, even whilst speaking different languages.I also found the film's sometimes meandering pace to be compelling as it gave us a chance to get to know people without necessarily figuring out where they all fit in Tár's life. It really made the film feel like a slice of life, where the story has a lot of context before the movie begins, and will go on after (naturally, given the ending).It's also a very well made film; the cinematography and sound design, thankfully, are impeccable. You really get sucked into whatever room you're in and there's an overbearing sense of atmosphere, a coldness associated with the refined world of classical music.Yet, this is also a movie I'd probably never watch again. It does a lot quite well, but is too simple a plot to waste so much time. Most of the other um...non, Tár characters, are pretty paper thin and we don't really have any particular subplots or complex relationship dynamics. As the movie lurches towards its end, I felt like it implies a strong emotional connection to what's happening, but it never really made it.This is a story that could've been told in a very conventional, straightforward way, but it's smarter than that. It takes a pretty nuanced and difficult-to-discuss subject and tackles it head on, but in a way that feels as if it's an aspect of the character's life and not the whole thing. Tár, like many Oscar bait films, has a lot to appreciate. But, I genuinely don't believe it's the sort of film many people will honestly remember and appreciate years down the road.","1 February 2023","6/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","Tar de Force","danchilton-71955","Director Todd Field is undeniably up to something different with his new film 'Tar'. Though what it is he's actually up to, what his goal is, I couldn't say. One thing for sure, It's strange. Very. And another thing for sure, it don't work.Proof?The first seven minutes are dedicated to scrolling the film's credits. No, not credits for Kate Blanchette and the rest of the cast. I'm talking about Key Grip, Best Boy, Stunt Man #1: the stuff you normally see at a film's conclusion: if you stick around for the credits.The film's next fifteen minutes feature a one on one interview between the film's protagonist Ms. Tar (Blanchette) and New Yorker Columnist Adam Gopnik (playing himself). The two are seated on an auditorium's stage, the audience silent, Ms. Blanchette / Tar fiercely intense as the Philharmonic Conductor describes her craft. This goes on far longer than you expect. And, in my opinion, far longer than necessary.The next segment is a lunch or dinner at which Ms. Tar and an associate (Who is he? I don't know. But I should.) discuss the politics and interpersonal relationships going on in Ms. Tar's Orchestra: The Berlin Philharmonic. The viewer is a fly on the wall to this gossip. We have to listen closely because much is mumbled. But never mind: the people gossiped about are people we don't know (yet) and so we - as in 'I' - tune out (perhaps a mistake but I could not help it). There are innuendoes a'plenty here; we learn that Ms. Tar is a lesbian and the man sitting across from her might be, or might once have been, attracted to men.Here, at about the thirty to forty minute mark, I considered leaving. But I didn't. You, however, may give in to the inclination to draw fresh air and frankly I would not blame you. But if you do consider leaving, let me tell you this:1. The rest of the film moves at a faster pace. Much faster. In fact the longer it goes, the faster the pace.2. Ms. Blanchette is, in fact, as fabulous as you've undoubtedly read. If you do stay, stay for her performance, not the story.3. The gossip you overheard at that lunch / dinner table? As the film progresses it will begin to make sense to you. Completely? No. But somewhat.4. Conductor Tar is a mighty presence with an 'Achilles Heel'. And that weakness has gotten her into a bit of trouble. But exactly what it is she did - I mean exactly - remains somehow vague. We never doubt her weaknesses, but would probably benefit from some more detail. Such as, What was her relationship to the person who got Tar into trouble. Was the person a student? A member of the symphony?5. The scenes of Blanchette / Tar conducting the orchestra are fine. They are not jaw-droppingly sensational (as other critics would have you believe). In short, I was. Disappointed.The way I see it, if you're reading this review it's likely you've already decided to see it. And if that's the case I hope this will assist you in adjusting your expectations. 'Adjusting', as in lowering.","19 October 2022","9/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","Cate should be nominated for an Oscar; it's that good.","JohnDeSando","During the first minute of this film, Cate Blanchett shows what an extraordinary actress she is. Her character, star conductor Lydia Tár, is waiting to go onstage. There is no dialogue, only body language. But even without words, Blanchett shows what Tár thinks and feels.Blanchett's remarkable performance is a large part of what makes this a good movie. But there's more. The very clever script gives us a lot to chew on afterards. Tár is a woman in the men-dominated world of classical music. She's not warm, empathic or even very sympathetic. In fact, she has many characteristics that are usually associated with men. She's vain, selfish and manipulative. And that's what gets her in trouble. At the start of the film, she seems to be one of the most admired women in the world. She is extremely famous and successful. At the end, everything has fallen apart.The film doesn't judge. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide if Lydia Tár is a victim or a culprit. Or maybe both at the same time. The viewer gets a lot of information to make up his (or her) mind. Director Todd Field gives us the story elements slowly, bit by bit. Take the scene where Lydia Tár gives a stern speech to a young girl who bullies her daughter. It shows that she is used to getting everyone in line, according to her wishes. That's useful information to interpret things later on in the movie.Tár is very much a modern movie. It has things to say about gender, about power, about social media, about being woke. But at the same time, it's a very old-fashioned movie. It takes its time. There are long scenes, and long takes. There's nothing modern in the way it is filmed. And that's a good thing.","6 November 2023","7/10",NA

I'm talking about Key Grip, Best Boy, Stunt Man #1: the stuff you normally see at a film's conclusion: if you stick around for the credits.The film's next fifteen minutes feature a one on one interview between the film's protagonist Ms. Tar (Blanchette) and New Yorker Columnist Adam Gopnik (playing himself). The two are seated on an auditorium's stage, the audience silent, Ms. Blanchette / Tar fiercely intense as the Philharmonic Conductor describes her craft. This goes on far longer than you expect. And, in my opinion, far longer than necessary.The next segment is a lunch or dinner at which Ms. Tar and an associate (Who is he? I don't know. But I should.) discuss the politics and interpersonal relationships going on in Ms. Tar's Orchestra: The Berlin Philharmonic. The viewer is a fly on the wall to this gossip. We have to listen closely because much is mumbled. But never mind: the people gossiped about are people we don't know (yet) and so we - as in 'I' - tune out (perhaps a mistake but I could not help it). There are innuendoes a'plenty here; we learn that Ms. Tar is a lesbian and the man sitting across from her might be, or might once have been, attracted to men.Here, at about the thirty to forty minute mark, I considered leaving. But I didn't. You, however, may give in to the inclination to draw fresh air and frankly I would not blame you. But if you do consider leaving, let me tell you this:1. The rest of the film moves at a faster pace. Much faster. In fact the longer it goes, the faster the pace.2. Ms. Blanchette is, in fact, as fabulous as you've undoubtedly read. If you do stay, stay for her performance, not the story.3. The gossip you overheard at that lunch / dinner table? As the film progresses it will begin to make sense to you. Completely? No. But somewhat.4. Conductor Tar is a mighty presence with an 'Achilles Heel'. And that weakness has gotten her into a bit of trouble. But exactly what it is she did - I mean exactly - remains somehow vague. We never doubt her weaknesses, but would probably benefit from some more detail. Such as, What was her relationship to the person who got Tar into trouble. Was the person a student? A member of the symphony?5. The scenes of Blanchette / Tar conducting the orchestra are fine. They are not jaw-droppingly sensational (as other critics would have you believe). In short, I was. Disappointed.The way I see it, if you're reading this review it's likely you've already decided to see it. And if that's the case I hope this will assist you in adjusting your expectations. 'Adjusting', as in lowering.","19 October 2022","9/10",NA
"Tár (2022)","Cate should be nominated for an Oscar; it's that good.","JohnDeSando","During the first minute of this film, Cate Blanchett shows what an extraordinary actress she is. Her character, star conductor Lydia Tár, is waiting to go onstage. There is no dialogue, only body language. But even without words, Blanchett shows what Tár thinks and feels.Blanchett's remarkable performance is a large part of what makes this a good movie. But there's more. The very clever script gives us a lot to chew on afterards. Tár is a woman in the men-dominated world of classical music. She's not warm, empathic or even very sympathetic. In fact, she has many characteristics that are usually associated with men. She's vain, selfish and manipulative. And that's what gets her in trouble. At the start of the film, she seems to be one of the most admired women in the world. She is extremely famous and successful. At the end, everything has fallen apart.The film doesn't judge. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide if Lydia Tár is a victim or a culprit. Or maybe both at the same time. The viewer gets a lot of information to make up his (or her) mind. Director Todd Field gives us the story elements slowly, bit by bit. Take the scene where Lydia Tár gives a stern speech to a young girl who bullies her daughter. It shows that she is used to getting everyone in line, according to her wishes. That's useful information to interpret things later on in the movie.Tár is very much a modern movie. It has things to say about gender, about power, about social media, about being woke. But at the same time, it's a very old-fashioned movie. It takes its time. There are long scenes, and long takes. There's nothing modern in the way it is filmed. And that's a good thing.","6 November 2023","7/10",NA

I hate that. But perhaps some others wont mind this at all.More bad: there is more troubling with this movie. The biggest let down of this movie is that it is VOID of ANY true DRAMA.It is one heck of a bore to watch.

"The Fabelmans (2022)","An origin story without capes","cliftonofun","I have been interested in this film since the moment I heard about it. As a kid whose first memorable movie theater experience was E. T., no filmmaker has more influenced the way I experience movies than Spielberg...and nothing influenced those movies more than his parents' divorce. So I was 100% ready for a personal tale, an origin story without capes or superpowers. No CGI. No motion capture. Just a movie about the power of families and stories through the eyes of a kid. It is just that... But it is more too. There's a generosity in the way that Spielberg makes sense of his own story after the fact. Nobody is a villain or hero. They are just people choosing between happiness and responsibility while realizing slowly and painfully that it may not have to be either/or. There were scenes that worked better than others (and I am still sorting through the third act), but it was fun to see him tell a story like this, whether it was his own or not.","13 November 2022","8/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","""A movie is a dream you never forget""","boblipton","It's watching Steven Spielberg grow up from a child terrified by the train crash in THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, to an adolescent film maker. He's pretty up front about the family issues and his parents' break up. I suspect he has realized that being an adult is a tough thing and is willing to forgive.At 150 minutes, it should feel self indulgent, but it never does, thanks to a terrific performance by Michelle Williams as the mother and Paul Dano as the father. No one seems to be acting, which is half the Spielberg magic. There are also great cameos by Judd Hirsch as the profane uncle who was a lion tamer, and David Lynch as John Ford.Some of the characters seem sketchily drawn, particularly the sisters, but that serves to emphasize Miss Williams, Dano, and Gabriel LaBelle as the Steven Spielberg character.

"The Fabelmans (2022)","A nice homage but too long and not one of Spielberg's best.","pkertes-59666","This semi-autobiographical film centres around Sammy Fabelman who is transfixed by the first movie he sees at age 6 and develops a passion for film making. Other themes explored with variable depth and success include the fracturing marriage of his parents, bullying and anti-semitism at high school, young love and coming of age, and selfishness in general.The movie is way too long and felt a little boring in the first 45minutes. It's nicely shot and well directed as you would expect, but the script is patchy and while the acting is generally excellent, the performances of Paul Dano and in particular Michelle Williams as Sammy's parents felt too affected and a little contrived - at times I felt I was watching filming on the set of a TV sitcom. I wonder still if this was deliberately instructed by Spielberg, but for me it doesn't work.Gabriel Labelle is the best as the teenage Sammy and Judd Hirsch is superb in a cameo as Uncle Boris. John Williams as always provides a perfect score and the visuals are superb.Overall it's worth seeing for a little insight into Spielberg's childhood but there is an unsatisfactory feel to the film as a whole.

"The Fabelmans (2022)","Throughout the entire 151 minute runtime, the horizon was in the middle.","Top_Dawg_Critic","This felt more like a revenge film targeting ""Bennie"" and Spielberg's high school bully ""Logan"" - characters names that have been changed to protect the real identity of those who may otherwise had legal slander recourse, had their real names been used. I'm even willing to bet Spielberg specifically cast actors that looked like his nemesis, just to spite them even more. Then we get a story of those that deprived him of a normal childhood, instead of those that inspired him. I still have no further knowledge of what made Spielberg a great filmmaker. The entire first 90 mins was utter boredom of a typical dysfunctional family - all just shallow filler, and the remaining 1 hour was just another high school drama story playing out, with very little substance. What the heck are all these critics raving about... there was nothing brilliant in this dull, bland, self-indulgent shallow slog. I learned more about Spielberg's mom than him. This is literally the most boring Spielberg film I've ever seen, and for that matter, a film no one should care about. Even the screenplay was riddled with unnecessary subplots that had more plot holes than engaging narrative. Granted, the dated set pieces and wardrobe were on point, and all casting and performances spot-on, and the score was perfect. But none of that matters when you're forced to sit through a two and a half hour film that leaves you frustrated and unsatisfied.

"The Fabelmans (2022)","Spielberg at his worst: sentimental and self-indulgent","paul-allaer","As ""The Fabelmans"" (2022 release; 150 min.) opens, it is ""January 10, 1952"" and 6 yo Steven, urrr I mean Sammy, needs some serious convincing by his parents to go see ""The Greatest Show On Earth"", but when he does, he is overwhelmed. He wants to recreate the train wreck from the movie, and it's his mom who suggests filming it on an 8mm camera... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is Steven Spielberg's long-awaited film of his youth. I love and respect Spielberg, but this is Spielberg at his worst: sentimental and self-indulgent. There isn't a single aspect of the movie that I found interesting or redeeming. Why did Spielberg assume that his family's comings and goings, including his parents' marital challenges, would be so unique and hence interesting, when in fact this is what happened to millions and millions of families in the 50s and early 60s. As a complete aside, as most of you know Spielberg lived in Cincinnati until age 11, then moved to Phoenix. A significant early part of the movie plays out in Cincinnati, but there is not a single reference, none, to Cincinnati. Why? In contrast, the second that the family is moving to Phoenix, Arizona, the area is mentioned multiple times in the film. I find it curious, to say the least.""The Fabelmans"" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim and then was released in US theaters just before Thanksgiving. Since then it has significantly underperformed at the box office (a mere $12 million after 7 weeks). The matinee screening where I saw this at the day after New Year's at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended well (I counted roughly 30 people). I honestly cannot think of any movie by Spielberg that is worse than this, and I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone. If you haven't seen this yet, please save yourself the time and money. You'll thank me later when you catch it streaming at some point.","6 January 2023","3/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","the fascination of the camera","dromasca","After 50 years of making movies, Steven Spielberg is still, in the 2020s, finding new muscles to work. His semi-autobiopic, The Fabelmans, is different in style, reach, and aim, than anything Spielberg has ever made. The consummate ringmaster has never helmed a film so modest. And for a director whose personal attachments are spread all over his filmography, The Fabelmans may also be his most intimate.The story of Sam Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle) is the story of Steven Spielberg, Jewish kid from Small Town USA, lover and later maker of movies. Sam shares with Steven three younger sisters, an eccentric concert pianist mother, an electrical engineer father, and a nearly identical path to movie directing. The names might be different, but obviously The Fabelmans is a dramatization of Steven Spielberg's childhood. It's certainly not our first indication of what the director thinks of such things as his parents' divorce, his interpersonal relationships with his family, or the images, moments, and memories that inspired him to make movies. Spielberg has brilliantly disguised these themes within his genre films; in alien invasion movies, dinosaur pictures, science fiction noirs, and family fantasy adventures. But with The Fabelmans, here comes the full reveal. It is a movie directly about family. His family. One must assume The Fabelmans is Steven Spielberg's last word on the subjects that have bewitched him throughout his career.The Fabelmans is kitchen sink drama all the way; no bells, no whistles, no magic realism or distracting style. In other words, no distance from these characters. The ones we have here are all quite well-realized. Paul Dano as Burt, the Fableman patriarch, is a sweetheart; surprisingly real despite an affected subservient speech pattern. Dano's character could have been an embarrassing caricature of the ""no fun, get a job"" father, but he comes out well-intentioned and completely three dimensional in a thankless role. Michelle Williams has the showier job playing mother Mitzy. She doesn't fumble the challenge, and in fact carves out a memorable personality from the more artistically inclined of Sam's parents. In the middle is Gabriel LaBelle, the latest model of the square-jawed, brown-eyed, young male muse that Spielberg has been searching for for decades now. Like Ansel Elgort, Tye Sheridan, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jeremy Irvine, and Shia LaBeouf before him (the man has a type), he's good enough. LaBelle is a likeable personality, a truly important metric for a performance like this, and he anchors the film admirably. Will it be that elusive star-making performance Spielberg has clearly been wanting from one of his young proteges? No. But it's a nice one.A few supporting players stop in for extended cameos. Judd Hirsh's quick turn as Uncle Boris may very well earn him an Oscar nomination. Hirsch has the classic showpiece monologue-two of them to be exact-and the sort of built-up respect needed for such a role. Young Chloe East on the other hand is a real discovery as Sam's high school girlfriend. Just when the movie needs a little energy, she comes in with the good stuff. Her's is a bright and living performance that never feels put on. Seth Rogan is there as well. A risky, maybe inspired casting choice, he's not bad.The Fabelmans is practically structureless, even at times aimless. There is no agreed-upon thesis that the movie is working toward, nor is there a feeling Spielberg is coaxing us into experiencing. As a cinematic project, it does not play to its director's strengths whatsoever. But we've seen the resiliency of Steven Spielberg before. Desert animal he truly is; able to adapt to changing landscapes and external challenges. By his standards, this is a tiny movie. Not the first quiet, artistic coming-of-age movie (in one of the movie's few missteps, it trots out a clichéd bullying subplot that drags the quality of the production way down), but in experienced, versatile hands, one of the very best.The Fabelmans certainly won't blow the doors off the box office, and for many, its sincere love for the craft of filmmaking will go completely unregistered. That narrow appeal, however, is precisely why The Fabelmans is destined to become a very special movie for people like me. I had my own 'Greatest Show on Earth' experience at six years old, when I saw Sam Raimi's Spider-man in one of the great big theaters where my aunt lived. Later, after I had discovered more of my favorites, developed a taste for the movies, I made my own. My cousins starred in one Jurassic Park rip-off as a team of scientists pursued by dragons in Shanghai. I became a film snob in college, and made short films with the guiding help of a professor who thought I had potential. I got a job as a documentarian and later directed a commercial or two of my own. All the while, I had my own family, who happen to be a lot like The Fabelmans, there to support and sometimes to trivialize, but whom I love with everything I have. Oh, it is sappy to talk about how personal The Fabelmans feels to me. I'm sure mine will not be the only review emphasizing how relatable this film is to someone with the artistic itch. But I assume I'm much like Sam Fabelman, and Steven Spielberg too, when I say that movies are my therapy. Our careers may never compare, but at least we'll share that.Mazal Tov.87/100.","10 February 2023","8/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","The Fabelmans","Prismark10","'The Fabelmans' is not good. Director and Co-Writer Steven Spielberg's heart was in the right place (the idea, the conceit, the structure is fine), but the execution fails to deliver. The film is too long by far, scenes run on forever, the story seems flabby and unfocused (and yes, that includes the hero's undying desire to become a film-maker).Here's what I believe Spielberg was attempting.(1) He is presenting the story of HIS life; how he (Spielberg) became the world famous film director.(2) In doing so, he portrays different periods of his life as though each were a different genre of movie. (a) The film's opening plays like a 50s family sitcom, complete with the goofy next-door neighbor. (b) A visit from an uncle plays like a horror film. (c) Adolescence is a 'Beach Blanket' movie with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, at other times a 'Blackboard Jungle' of bigoted and roughneck bullies. (d) We've got 'OZ's' Yellow Brick Road of a finale, preceded by 'OZ's' Dorothy / Spielberg meeting with the wizard himself and receiving his advice. (e) Add to this 'The Conversation' / 'Blow Out' / 'Blow Up' fascination with studying taped video and or audio, inch by inch, in order to fully understand what is actually taking place.(3) Now the use of film genres in this way could be a very satisfying. It would tell us that Spielberg always viewed his life, while living it, as a movie. And it might have worked were the film less talky, better written (the dialogue is awful), and faster paced. And perhaps better shot. There is something flat up there on the screen; nearly every scene feels like the one before and the one that follows. I can't say why. It just does.I wish I'd liked the film. As a big fan of Spielberg's earlier work, I had strong rooting interest for him to meet his usual high standard.And it's likely you do too. And as such you might well look past my criticisms of the film; might hold him to a less lofty standard.You might well enjoy it.I imagine that many viewers will.","1 December 2022","4/10",NA

Perhaps if it had something new to say, portrayed a family more uniquely in their way, a novel circumstance, to catch your eye, a second glance, not monotony of people day to day.

"The Fabelmans (2022)","Spielberg's Heart Was In The Right Place","levybob","So, the legend himself Steven Spielberg makes a movie about making movies. We've seen bits of this already in 'Super 8'. Now he turns the 'Super 8' idea into a coming of age family movie. But 'The Fabelmans' was so uneven in its narration that I'm not sure what to make of it.The film starts off introducing the Jewish Fabelman family. There's the Dad, Burt (Paul Dano), who is a brilliant scientist and inventor. His wife is Mitzi (Michelle Williams), who is a pianist. Then there are the children, of which only Sammy (Gabriel LaBelle) is noteworthy. And then there's the family friend, Bennie (Seth Rogen), who turns out to be more than just a friend...From the very first time a young Sammy went to the movies with his parents, he became interested in making movies. This is a passion he soon pursued, and he would make movies and show them at school, to great praise from the audience. Does this sound like the life and times of Steven Spielberg?This is a very, very long movie, and a great deal of the movie's runtime is made up by Sammy making movies, and then showing them to family and friends. Why this takes up so much screen time is beyond reason, as this does not contribute to the film in any way. Cool, we understand, he's making movies at a young age, but do we actually want to see everything of what he does? Just a hint of it would have sufficed. We get the picture.Judd Hirsch stars as Mitzi's uncle, Boris, whom her deceased mother warned her against in a dream. I was expecting so much from this character - especially also since Judd Hirsch received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor - but he was in this long film for only about 10 minutes and all he did was talk to Sammy. That's it! When he left the next morning, he was never seen again. What was the point? The film would not have played out any differently had this character not been in the movie at all.When the family moved to California and Sam was being bullied at school, I completely lost interest. It felt like a completely different movie and even the narration transitioned from interesting drama to uninteresting comedy - complete with religious blasphemy. What the hell?The most interesting characters with the promise of intrigue, were Mitzi and Bennie. No offense, Mr Spielberg, but the film had the potential to take so many interesting turns. Instead, the final act was primarily aimed at a teen demographic, and an uninteresting one at that. The horizon was in the middle. (If you've seen the movie, you'll know what this means).Yes, the performances were very good, and 'The Fabelmans' is beautifully filmed. Unfortunately, it was just way overlong, and ultimately a bit boring towards the end.","13 December 2022","2/10",NA

I love and respect Spielberg, but this is Spielberg at his worst: sentimental and self-indulgent. There isn't a single aspect of the movie that I found interesting or redeeming. Why did Spielberg assume that his family's comings and goings, including his parents' marital challenges, would be so unique and hence interesting, when in fact this is what happened to millions and millions of families in the 50s and early 60s. As a complete aside, as most of you know Spielberg lived in Cincinnati until age 11, then moved to Phoenix. A significant early part of the movie plays out in Cincinnati, but there is not a single reference, none, to Cincinnati. Why? In contrast, the second that the family is moving to Phoenix, Arizona, the area is mentioned multiple times in the film. I find it curious, to say the least.""The Fabelmans"" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim and then was released in US theaters just before Thanksgiving. Since then it has significantly underperformed at the box office (a mere $12 million after 7 weeks). The matinee screening where I saw this at the day after New Year's at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended well (I counted roughly 30 people). I honestly cannot think of any movie by Spielberg that is worse than this, and I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone. If you haven't seen this yet, please save yourself the time and money. You'll thank me later when you catch it streaming at some point.","6 January 2023","3/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","the fascination of the camera","dromasca","After 50 years of making movies, Steven Spielberg is still, in the 2020s, finding new muscles to work. His semi-autobiopic, The Fabelmans, is different in style, reach, and aim, than anything Spielberg has ever made. The consummate ringmaster has never helmed a film so modest. And for a director whose personal attachments are spread all over his filmography, The Fabelmans may also be his most intimate.The story of Sam Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle) is the story of Steven Spielberg, Jewish kid from Small Town USA, lover and later maker of movies. Sam shares with Steven three younger sisters, an eccentric concert pianist mother, an electrical engineer father, and a nearly identical path to movie directing. The names might be different, but obviously The Fabelmans is a dramatization of Steven Spielberg's childhood. It's certainly not our first indication of what the director thinks of such things as his parents' divorce, his interpersonal relationships with his family, or the images, moments, and memories that inspired him to make movies. Spielberg has brilliantly disguised these themes within his genre films; in alien invasion movies, dinosaur pictures, science fiction noirs, and family fantasy adventures. But with The Fabelmans, here comes the full reveal. It is a movie directly about family. His family. One must assume The Fabelmans is Steven Spielberg's last word on the subjects that have bewitched him throughout his career.The Fabelmans is kitchen sink drama all the way; no bells, no whistles, no magic realism or distracting style. In other words, no distance from these characters. The ones we have here are all quite well-realized. Paul Dano as Burt, the Fableman patriarch, is a sweetheart; surprisingly real despite an affected subservient speech pattern. Dano's character could have been an embarrassing caricature of the ""no fun, get a job"" father, but he comes out well-intentioned and completely three dimensional in a thankless role. Michelle Williams has the showier job playing mother Mitzy. She doesn't fumble the challenge, and in fact carves out a memorable personality from the more artistically inclined of Sam's parents. In the middle is Gabriel LaBelle, the latest model of the square-jawed, brown-eyed, young male muse that Spielberg has been searching for for decades now. Like Ansel Elgort, Tye Sheridan, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jeremy Irvine, and Shia LaBeouf before him (the man has a type), he's good enough. LaBelle is a likeable personality, a truly important metric for a performance like this, and he anchors the film admirably. Will it be that elusive star-making performance Spielberg has clearly been wanting from one of his young proteges? No. But it's a nice one.A few supporting players stop in for extended cameos. Judd Hirsh's quick turn as Uncle Boris may very well earn him an Oscar nomination. Hirsch has the classic showpiece monologue-two of them to be exact-and the sort of built-up respect needed for such a role. Young Chloe East on the other hand is a real discovery as Sam's high school girlfriend. Just when the movie needs a little energy, she comes in with the good stuff. Her's is a bright and living performance that never feels put on. Seth Rogan is there as well. A risky, maybe inspired casting choice, he's not bad.The Fabelmans is practically structureless, even at times aimless. There is no agreed-upon thesis that the movie is working toward, nor is there a feeling Spielberg is coaxing us into experiencing. As a cinematic project, it does not play to its director's strengths whatsoever. But we've seen the resiliency of Steven Spielberg before. Desert animal he truly is; able to adapt to changing landscapes and external challenges. By his standards, this is a tiny movie. Not the first quiet, artistic coming-of-age movie (in one of the movie's few missteps, it trots out a clichéd bullying subplot that drags the quality of the production way down), but in experienced, versatile hands, one of the very best.The Fabelmans certainly won't blow the doors off the box office, and for many, its sincere love for the craft of filmmaking will go completely unregistered. That narrow appeal, however, is precisely why The Fabelmans is destined to become a very special movie for people like me. I had my own 'Greatest Show on Earth' experience at six years old, when I saw Sam Raimi's Spider-man in one of the great big theaters where my aunt lived. Later, after I had discovered more of my favorites, developed a taste for the movies, I made my own. My cousins starred in one Jurassic Park rip-off as a team of scientists pursued by dragons in Shanghai. I became a film snob in college, and made short films with the guiding help of a professor who thought I had potential. I got a job as a documentarian and later directed a commercial or two of my own. All the while, I had my own family, who happen to be a lot like The Fabelmans, there to support and sometimes to trivialize, but whom I love with everything I have. Oh, it is sappy to talk about how personal The Fabelmans feels to me. I'm sure mine will not be the only review emphasizing how relatable this film is to someone with the artistic itch. But I assume I'm much like Sam Fabelman, and Steven Spielberg too, when I say that movies are my therapy. Our careers may never compare, but at least we'll share that.Mazal Tov.87/100.","10 February 2023","8/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","The Fabelmans","Prismark10","'The Fabelmans' is not good. Director and Co-Writer Steven Spielberg's heart was in the right place (the idea, the conceit, the structure is fine), but the execution fails to deliver. The film is too long by far, scenes run on forever, the story seems flabby and unfocused (and yes, that includes the hero's undying desire to become a film-maker).Here's what I believe Spielberg was attempting.(1) He is presenting the story of HIS life; how he (Spielberg) became the world famous film director.(2) In doing so, he portrays different periods of his life as though each were a different genre of movie. (a) The film's opening plays like a 50s family sitcom, complete with the goofy next-door neighbor. (b) A visit from an uncle plays like a horror film. (c) Adolescence is a 'Beach Blanket' movie with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, at other times a 'Blackboard Jungle' of bigoted and roughneck bullies. (d) We've got 'OZ's' Yellow Brick Road of a finale, preceded by 'OZ's' Dorothy / Spielberg meeting with the wizard himself and receiving his advice. (e) Add to this 'The Conversation' / 'Blow Out' / 'Blow Up' fascination with studying taped video and or audio, inch by inch, in order to fully understand what is actually taking place.(3) Now the use of film genres in this way could be a very satisfying. It would tell us that Spielberg always viewed his life, while living it, as a movie. And it might have worked were the film less talky, better written (the dialogue is awful), and faster paced. And perhaps better shot. There is something flat up there on the screen; nearly every scene feels like the one before and the one that follows. I can't say why. It just does.I wish I'd liked the film. As a big fan of Spielberg's earlier work, I had strong rooting interest for him to meet his usual high standard.And it's likely you do too. And as such you might well look past my criticisms of the film; might hold him to a less lofty standard.You might well enjoy it.I imagine that many viewers will.","1 December 2022","4/10",NA

Perhaps if it had something new to say, portrayed a family more uniquely in their way, a novel circumstance, to catch your eye, a second glance, not monotony of people day to day. If you make it to the end you might just wonder, why fine actors chose to loot your time and plunder (I'll give you three guesses but you only need one), must be quite a fallow year, to want to make this and appear, in something that's so dull, it makes you want to slumber.","28 November 2022","8/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","Spielberg's Heart Was In The Right Place","levybob","So, the legend himself Steven Spielberg makes a movie about making movies. We've seen bits of this already in 'Super 8'. Now he turns the 'Super 8' idea into a coming of age family movie. But 'The Fabelmans' was so uneven in its narration that I'm not sure what to make of it.The film starts off introducing the Jewish Fabelman family. There's the Dad, Burt (Paul Dano), who is a brilliant scientist and inventor. His wife is Mitzi (Michelle Williams), who is a pianist. Then there are the children, of which only Sammy (Gabriel LaBelle) is noteworthy. And then there's the family friend, Bennie (Seth Rogen), who turns out to be more than just a friend...From the very first time a young Sammy went to the movies with his parents, he became interested in making movies. This is a passion he soon pursued, and he would make movies and show them at school, to great praise from the audience. Does this sound like the life and times of Steven Spielberg?This is a very, very long movie, and a great deal of the movie's runtime is made up by Sammy making movies, and then showing them to family and friends. Why this takes up so much screen time is beyond reason, as this does not contribute to the film in any way. Cool, we understand, he's making movies at a young age, but do we actually want to see everything of what he does? Just a hint of it would have sufficed. We get the picture.Judd Hirsch stars as Mitzi's uncle, Boris, whom her deceased mother warned her against in a dream. I was expecting so much from this character - especially also since Judd Hirsch received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor - but he was in this long film for only about 10 minutes and all he did was talk to Sammy. That's it! When he left the next morning, he was never seen again. What was the point? The film would not have played out any differently had this character not been in the movie at all.When the family moved to California and Sam was being bullied at school, I completely lost interest. It felt like a completely different movie and even the narration transitioned from interesting drama to uninteresting comedy - complete with religious blasphemy. What the hell?The most interesting characters with the promise of intrigue, were Mitzi and Bennie. No offense, Mr Spielberg, but the film had the potential to take so many interesting turns. Instead, the final act was primarily aimed at a teen demographic, and an uninteresting one at that. The horizon was in the middle. (If you've seen the movie, you'll know what this means).Yes, the performances were very good, and 'The Fabelmans' is beautifully filmed. Unfortunately, it was just way overlong, and ultimately a bit boring towards the end.","13 December 2022","2/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","An origin story without capes","cliftonofun","I have been interested in this film since the moment I heard about it. As a kid whose first memorable movie theater experience was E. T., no filmmaker has more influenced the way I experience movies than Spielberg...and nothing influenced those movies more than his parents' divorce. So I was 100% ready for a personal tale, an origin story without capes or superpowers. No CGI. No motion capture. Just a movie about the power of families and stories through the eyes of a kid. It is just that... But it is more too. There's a generosity in the way that Spielberg makes sense of his own story after the fact. Nobody is a villain or hero. They are just people choosing between happiness and responsibility while realizing slowly and painfully that it may not have to be either/or. There were scenes that worked better than others (and I am still sorting through the third act), but it was fun to see him tell a story like this, whether it was his own or not.","13 November 2022","8/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","""A movie is a dream you never forget""","boblipton","It's watching Steven Spielberg grow up from a child terrified by the train crash in THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, to an adolescent film maker. He's pretty up front about the family issues and his parents' break up. I suspect he has realized that being an adult is a tough thing and is willing to forgive.At 150 minutes, it should feel self indulgent, but it never does, thanks to a terrific performance by Michelle Williams as the mother and Paul Dano as the father. No one seems to be acting, which is half the Spielberg magic. There are also great cameos by Judd Hirsch as the profane uncle who was a lion tamer, and David Lynch as John Ford.Some of the characters seem sketchily drawn, particularly the sisters, but that serves to emphasize Miss Williams, Dano, and Gabriel LaBelle as the Steven Spielberg character. Is she t that Spielberg and his frequent collaborator Tony Kühner, have drawn a fine portrait of a Jewish post-war family, when things were supposed to be so very bland... but really, people were living their lives.","7 January 2023","8/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","A nice homage but too long and not one of Spielberg's best.","pkertes-59666","This semi-autobiographical film centres around Sammy Fabelman who is transfixed by the first movie he sees at age 6 and develops a passion for film making. Other themes explored with variable depth and success include the fracturing marriage of his parents, bullying and anti-semitism at high school, young love and coming of age, and selfishness in general.The movie is way too long and felt a little boring in the first 45minutes. It's nicely shot and well directed as you would expect, but the script is patchy and while the acting is generally excellent, the performances of Paul Dano and in particular Michelle Williams as Sammy's parents felt too affected and a little contrived - at times I felt I was watching filming on the set of a TV sitcom. I wonder still if this was deliberately instructed by Spielberg, but for me it doesn't work.Gabriel Labelle is the best as the teenage Sammy and Judd Hirsch is superb in a cameo as Uncle Boris. John Williams as always provides a perfect score and the visuals are superb.Overall it's worth seeing for a little insight into Spielberg's childhood but there is an unsatisfactory feel to the film as a whole. I think it could have been so much better.","5 March 2023","7/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","This falls far short of the hype,","wisewebwoman","It was far too stretched out. Like in breaking point elastic.An irritating factor at the beginning (and this is one of my pet peeves) is that the blue eyed boy becomes a brown-eyed teenager/adult. This might be nit-picking to some but it jerks me right out of the film.The scenes with the train were way overplayed, We get it Steven. Truly.The film is more about the mother than her son. And their dynamic didn't feel real either. She had three other children and there is virtually nothing of her interactions with them.I am a huge admirer of SS and his films but this is, I hate to say this, cringe worthy. That scene where the bully follows him to the locker room is unbelievable. No thick bully would have that kind of insight into his own behaviour.I get the fifties vibe, the Beach Blanket Bingo of that era,

"The Fabelmans (2022)","Throughout the entire 151 minute runtime, the horizon was in the middle.","Top_Dawg_Critic","This felt more like a revenge film targeting ""Bennie"" and Spielberg's high school bully ""Logan"" - characters names that have been changed to protect the real identity of those who may otherwise had legal slander recourse, had their real names been used. I'm even willing to bet Spielberg specifically cast actors that looked like his nemesis, just to spite them even more. Then we get a story of those that deprived him of a normal childhood, instead of those that inspired him. I still have no further knowledge of what made Spielberg a great filmmaker. The entire first 90 mins was utter boredom of a typical dysfunctional family - all just shallow filler, and the remaining 1 hour was just another high school drama story playing out, with very little substance. What the heck are all these critics raving about... there was nothing brilliant in this dull, bland, self-indulgent shallow slog. I learned more about Spielberg's mom than him. This is literally the most boring Spielberg film I've ever seen, and for that matter, a film no one should care about. Even the screenplay was riddled with unnecessary subplots that had more plot holes than engaging narrative. Granted, the dated set pieces and wardrobe were on point, and all casting and performances spot-on, and the score was perfect. But none of that matters when you're forced to sit through a two and a half hour film that leaves you frustrated and unsatisfied. It's amusing how another great filmmaker, James Cameron, gives us Avatar 2, and Spielberg gives us this nonsense vanity project. You can tell one is falling from grace and the other rising past. It's a very generous 5/10 from me.","2 January 2023","5/10",NA

There were scenes that worked better than others (and I am still sorting through the third act), but it was fun to see him tell a story like this, whether it was his own or not.","13 November 2022","8/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","""A movie is a dream you never forget""","boblipton","It's watching Steven Spielberg grow up from a child terrified by the train crash in THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, to an adolescent film maker. He's pretty up front about the family issues and his parents' break up. I suspect he has realized that being an adult is a tough thing and is willing to forgive.At 150 minutes, it should feel self indulgent, but it never does, thanks to a terrific performance by Michelle Williams as the mother and Paul Dano as the father. No one seems to be acting, which is half the Spielberg magic. There are also great cameos by Judd Hirsch as the profane uncle who was a lion tamer, and David Lynch as John Ford.Some of the characters seem sketchily drawn, particularly the sisters, but that serves to emphasize Miss Williams, Dano, and Gabriel LaBelle as the Steven Spielberg character. Is she t that Spielberg and his frequent collaborator Tony Kühner, have drawn a fine portrait of a Jewish post-war family, when things were supposed to be so very bland... but really, people were living their lives.","7 January 2023","8/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","A nice homage but too long and not one of Spielberg's best.","pkertes-59666","This semi-autobiographical film centres around Sammy Fabelman who is transfixed by the first movie he sees at age 6 and develops a passion for film making. Other themes explored with variable depth and success include the fracturing marriage of his parents, bullying and anti-semitism at high school, young love and coming of age, and selfishness in general.The movie is way too long and felt a little boring in the first 45minutes. It's nicely shot and well directed as you would expect, but the script is patchy and while the acting is generally excellent, the performances of Paul Dano and in particular Michelle Williams as Sammy's parents felt too affected and a little contrived - at times I felt I was watching filming on the set of a TV sitcom. I wonder still if this was deliberately instructed by Spielberg, but for me it doesn't work.Gabriel Labelle is the best as the teenage Sammy and Judd Hirsch is superb in a cameo as Uncle Boris. John Williams as always provides a perfect score and the visuals are superb.Overall it's worth seeing for a little insight into Spielberg's childhood but there is an unsatisfactory feel to the film as a whole.

"The Fabelmans (2022)","Throughout the entire 151 minute runtime, the horizon was in the middle.","Top_Dawg_Critic","This felt more like a revenge film targeting ""Bennie"" and Spielberg's high school bully ""Logan"" - characters names that have been changed to protect the real identity of those who may otherwise had legal slander recourse, had their real names been used. I'm even willing to bet Spielberg specifically cast actors that looked like his nemesis, just to spite them even more. Then we get a story of those that deprived him of a normal childhood, instead of those that inspired him. I still have no further knowledge of what made Spielberg a great filmmaker. The entire first 90 mins was utter boredom of a typical dysfunctional family - all just shallow filler, and the remaining 1 hour was just another high school drama story playing out, with very little substance. What the heck are all these critics raving about... there was nothing brilliant in this dull, bland, self-indulgent shallow slog. I learned more about Spielberg's mom than him. This is literally the most boring Spielberg film I've ever seen, and for that matter, a film no one should care about. Even the screenplay was riddled with unnecessary subplots that had more plot holes than engaging narrative. Granted, the dated set pieces and wardrobe were on point, and all casting and performances spot-on, and the score was perfect. But none of that matters when you're forced to sit through a two and a half hour film that leaves you frustrated and unsatisfied.

"The Fabelmans (2022)","Spielberg at his worst: sentimental and self-indulgent","paul-allaer","As ""The Fabelmans"" (2022 release; 150 min.) opens, it is ""January 10, 1952"" and 6 yo Steven, urrr I mean Sammy, needs some serious convincing by his parents to go see ""The Greatest Show On Earth"", but when he does, he is overwhelmed. He wants to recreate the train wreck from the movie, and it's his mom who suggests filming it on an 8mm camera... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is Steven Spielberg's long-awaited film of his youth. I love and respect Spielberg, but this is Spielberg at his worst: sentimental and self-indulgent. There isn't a single aspect of the movie that I found interesting or redeeming. Why did Spielberg assume that his family's comings and goings, including his parents' marital challenges, would be so unique and hence interesting, when in fact this is what happened to millions and millions of families in the 50s and early 60s. As a complete aside, as most of you know Spielberg lived in Cincinnati until age 11, then moved to Phoenix. A significant early part of the movie plays out in Cincinnati, but there is not a single reference, none, to Cincinnati. Why? In contrast, the second that the family is moving to Phoenix, Arizona, the area is mentioned multiple times in the film. I find it curious, to say the least.""The Fabelmans"" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim and then was released in US theaters just before Thanksgiving. Since then it has significantly underperformed at the box office (a mere $12 million after 7 weeks). The matinee screening where I saw this at the day after New Year's at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended well (I counted roughly 30 people). I honestly cannot think of any movie by Spielberg that is worse than this, and I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone. If you haven't seen this yet, please save yourself the time and money. You'll thank me later when you catch it streaming at some point.","6 January 2023","3/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","the fascination of the camera","dromasca","After 50 years of making movies, Steven Spielberg is still, in the 2020s, finding new muscles to work. His semi-autobiopic, The Fabelmans, is different in style, reach, and aim, than anything Spielberg has ever made. The consummate ringmaster has never helmed a film so modest. And for a director whose personal attachments are spread all over his filmography, The Fabelmans may also be his most intimate.The story of Sam Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle) is the story of Steven Spielberg, Jewish kid from Small Town USA, lover and later maker of movies. Sam shares with Steven three younger sisters, an eccentric concert pianist mother, an electrical engineer father, and a nearly identical path to movie directing. The names might be different, but obviously The Fabelmans is a dramatization of Steven Spielberg's childhood. It's certainly not our first indication of what the director thinks of such things as his parents' divorce, his interpersonal relationships with his family, or the images, moments, and memories that inspired him to make movies. Spielberg has brilliantly disguised these themes within his genre films; in alien invasion movies, dinosaur pictures, science fiction noirs, and family fantasy adventures. But with The Fabelmans, here comes the full reveal. It is a movie directly about family. His family. One must assume The Fabelmans is Steven Spielberg's last word on the subjects that have bewitched him throughout his career.The Fabelmans is kitchen sink drama all the way; no bells, no whistles, no magic realism or distracting style. In other words, no distance from these characters. The ones we have here are all quite well-realized. Paul Dano as Burt, the Fableman patriarch, is a sweetheart; surprisingly real despite an affected subservient speech pattern. Dano's character could have been an embarrassing caricature of the ""no fun, get a job"" father, but he comes out well-intentioned and completely three dimensional in a thankless role. Michelle Williams has the showier job playing mother Mitzy. She doesn't fumble the challenge, and in fact carves out a memorable personality from the more artistically inclined of Sam's parents. In the middle is Gabriel LaBelle, the latest model of the square-jawed, brown-eyed, young male muse that Spielberg has been searching for for decades now. Like Ansel Elgort, Tye Sheridan, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jeremy Irvine, and Shia LaBeouf before him (the man has a type), he's good enough. LaBelle is a likeable personality, a truly important metric for a performance like this, and he anchors the film admirably. Will it be that elusive star-making performance Spielberg has clearly been wanting from one of his young proteges? No. But it's a nice one.A few supporting players stop in for extended cameos. Judd Hirsh's quick turn as Uncle Boris may very well earn him an Oscar nomination. Hirsch has the classic showpiece monologue-two of them to be exact-and the sort of built-up respect needed for such a role. Young Chloe East on the other hand is a real discovery as Sam's high school girlfriend. Just when the movie needs a little energy, she comes in with the good stuff. Her's is a bright and living performance that never feels put on. Seth Rogan is there as well. A risky, maybe inspired casting choice, he's not bad.The Fabelmans is practically structureless, even at times aimless. There is no agreed-upon thesis that the movie is working toward, nor is there a feeling Spielberg is coaxing us into experiencing. As a cinematic project, it does not play to its director's strengths whatsoever. But we've seen the resiliency of Steven Spielberg before. Desert animal he truly is; able to adapt to changing landscapes and external challenges. By his standards, this is a tiny movie. Not the first quiet, artistic coming-of-age movie (in one of the movie's few missteps, it trots out a clichéd bullying subplot that drags the quality of the production way down), but in experienced, versatile hands, one of the very best.The Fabelmans certainly won't blow the doors off the box office, and for many, its sincere love for the craft of filmmaking will go completely unregistered. That narrow appeal, however, is precisely why The Fabelmans is destined to become a very special movie for people like me. I had my own 'Greatest Show on Earth' experience at six years old, when I saw Sam Raimi's Spider-man in one of the great big theaters where my aunt lived. Later, after I had discovered more of my favorites, developed a taste for the movies, I made my own. My cousins starred in one Jurassic Park rip-off as a team of scientists pursued by dragons in Shanghai. I became a film snob in college, and made short films with the guiding help of a professor who thought I had potential. I got a job as a documentarian and later directed a commercial or two of my own. All the while, I had my own family, who happen to be a lot like The Fabelmans, there to support and sometimes to trivialize, but whom I love with everything I have. Oh, it is sappy to talk about how personal The Fabelmans feels to me. I'm sure mine will not be the only review emphasizing how relatable this film is to someone with the artistic itch. But I assume I'm much like Sam Fabelman, and Steven Spielberg too, when I say that movies are my therapy. Our careers may never compare, but at least we'll share that.Mazal Tov.87/100.","10 February 2023","8/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","The Fabelmans","Prismark10","'The Fabelmans' is not good. Director and Co-Writer Steven Spielberg's heart was in the right place (the idea, the conceit, the structure is fine), but the execution fails to deliver. The film is too long by far, scenes run on forever, the story seems flabby and unfocused (and yes, that includes the hero's undying desire to become a film-maker).Here's what I believe Spielberg was attempting.(1) He is presenting the story of HIS life; how he (Spielberg) became the world famous film director.(2) In doing so, he portrays different periods of his life as though each were a different genre of movie. (a) The film's opening plays like a 50s family sitcom, complete with the goofy next-door neighbor. (b) A visit from an uncle plays like a horror film. (c) Adolescence is a 'Beach Blanket' movie with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, at other times a 'Blackboard Jungle' of bigoted and roughneck bullies. (d) We've got 'OZ's' Yellow Brick Road of a finale, preceded by 'OZ's' Dorothy / Spielberg meeting with the wizard himself and receiving his advice. (e) Add to this 'The Conversation' / 'Blow Out' / 'Blow Up' fascination with studying taped video and or audio, inch by inch, in order to fully understand what is actually taking place.(3) Now the use of film genres in this way could be a very satisfying. It would tell us that Spielberg always viewed his life, while living it, as a movie. And it might have worked were the film less talky, better written (the dialogue is awful), and faster paced. And perhaps better shot. There is something flat up there on the screen; nearly every scene feels like the one before and the one that follows. I can't say why. It just does.I wish I'd liked the film. As a big fan of Spielberg's earlier work, I had strong rooting interest for him to meet his usual high standard.And it's likely you do too. And as such you might well look past my criticisms of the film; might hold him to a less lofty standard.You might well enjoy it.I imagine that many viewers will.","1 December 2022","4/10",NA

Perhaps if it had something new to say, portrayed a family more uniquely in their way, a novel circumstance, to catch your eye, a second glance, not monotony of people day to day. If you make it to the end you might just wonder, why fine actors chose to loot your time and plunder (I'll give you three guesses but you only need one), must be quite a fallow year, to want to make this and appear, in something that's so dull, it makes you want to slumber.","28 November 2022","8/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","Spielberg's Heart Was In The Right Place","levybob","So, the legend himself Steven Spielberg makes a movie about making movies. We've seen bits of this already in 'Super 8'. Now he turns the 'Super 8' idea into a coming of age family movie. But 'The Fabelmans' was so uneven in its narration that I'm not sure what to make of it.The film starts off introducing the Jewish Fabelman family. There's the Dad, Burt (Paul Dano), who is a brilliant scientist and inventor. His wife is Mitzi (Michelle Williams), who is a pianist. Then there are the children, of which only Sammy (Gabriel LaBelle) is noteworthy. And then there's the family friend, Bennie (Seth Rogen), who turns out to be more than just a friend...From the very first time a young Sammy went to the movies with his parents, he became interested in making movies. This is a passion he soon pursued, and he would make movies and show them at school, to great praise from the audience. Does this sound like the life and times of Steven Spielberg?This is a very, very long movie, and a great deal of the movie's runtime is made up by Sammy making movies, and then showing them to family and friends. Why this takes up so much screen time is beyond reason, as this does not contribute to the film in any way. Cool, we understand, he's making movies at a young age, but do we actually want to see everything of what he does? Just a hint of it would have sufficed. We get the picture.Judd Hirsch stars as Mitzi's uncle, Boris, whom her deceased mother warned her against in a dream. I was expecting so much from this character - especially also since Judd Hirsch received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor - but he was in this long film for only about 10 minutes and all he did was talk to Sammy. That's it! When he left the next morning, he was never seen again. What was the point? The film would not have played out any differently had this character not been in the movie at all.When the family moved to California and Sam was being bullied at school, I completely lost interest. It felt like a completely different movie and even the narration transitioned from interesting drama to uninteresting comedy - complete with religious blasphemy. What the hell?The most interesting characters with the promise of intrigue, were Mitzi and Bennie. No offense, Mr Spielberg, but the film had the potential to take so many interesting turns. Instead, the final act was primarily aimed at a teen demographic, and an uninteresting one at that. The horizon was in the middle. (If you've seen the movie, you'll know what this means).Yes, the performances were very good, and 'The Fabelmans' is beautifully filmed. Unfortunately, it was just way overlong, and ultimately a bit boring towards the end.","13 December 2022","2/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","An origin story without capes","cliftonofun","I have been interested in this film since the moment I heard about it. As a kid whose first memorable movie theater experience was E.

So I was 100% ready for a personal tale, an origin story without capes or superpowers. No CGI. No motion capture. Just a movie about the power of families and stories through the eyes of a kid. It is just that... But it is more too. There's a generosity in the way that Spielberg makes sense of his own story after the fact. Nobody is a villain or hero. They are just people choosing between happiness and responsibility while realizing slowly and painfully that it may not have to be either/or.

The film is too long by far, scenes run on forever, the story seems flabby and unfocused (and yes, that includes the hero's undying desire to become a film-maker).Here's what I believe Spielberg was attempting.(1) He is presenting the story of HIS life; how he (Spielberg) became the world famous film director.(2) In doing so, he portrays different periods of his life as though each were a different genre of movie. (a) The film's opening plays like a 50s family sitcom, complete with the goofy next-door neighbor. (b) A visit from an uncle plays like a horror film. (c) Adolescence is a 'Beach Blanket' movie with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, at other times a 'Blackboard Jungle' of bigoted and roughneck bullies. (d) We've got 'OZ's' Yellow Brick Road of a finale, preceded by 'OZ's' Dorothy / Spielberg meeting with the wizard himself and receiving his advice. (e) Add to this 'The Conversation' / 'Blow Out' / 'Blow Up' fascination with studying taped video and or audio, inch by inch, in order to fully understand what is actually taking place.(3) Now the use of film genres in this way could be a very satisfying. It would tell us that Spielberg always viewed his life, while living it, as a movie. And it might have worked were the film less talky, better written (the dialogue is awful), and faster paced. And perhaps better shot. There is something flat up there on the screen; nearly every scene feels like the one before and the one that follows. I can't say why. It just does.I wish I'd liked the film. As a big fan of Spielberg's earlier work, I had strong rooting interest for him to meet his usual high standard.And it's likely you do too. And as such you might well look past my criticisms of the film; might hold him to a less lofty standard.You might well enjoy it.I imagine that many viewers will.","1 December 2022","4/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","Dear Diary, It's Steven","jaredpahl","... with a very central horizon, albeit with a rather successful director revealing his grounding, but you've seen it many times before, watching other people grow up's such a chore, we've all been adolescent, distracted and pubescent, it's a boring set of takes and you will snore. Perhaps if it had something new to say, portrayed a family more uniquely in their way, a novel circumstance, to catch your eye, a second glance, not monotony of people day to day. If you make it to the end you might just wonder, why fine actors chose to loot your time and plunder (I'll give you three guesses but you only need one), must be quite a fallow year, to want to make this and appear, in something that's so dull, it makes you want to slumber.","28 November 2022","8/10",NA
"The Fabelmans (2022)","Spielberg's Heart Was In The Right Place","levybob","So, the legend himself Steven Spielberg makes a movie about making movies. We've seen bits of this already in 'Super 8'. Now he turns the 'Super 8' idea into a coming of age family movie. But 'The Fabelmans' was so uneven in its narration that I'm not sure what to make of it.The film starts off introducing the Jewish Fabelman family. There's the Dad, Burt (Paul Dano), who is a brilliant scientist and inventor. His wife is Mitzi (Michelle Williams), who is a pianist. Then there are the children, of which only Sammy (Gabriel LaBelle) is noteworthy. And then there's the family friend, Bennie (Seth Rogen), who turns out to be more than just a friend...From the very first time a young Sammy went to the movies with his parents, he became interested in making movies. This is a passion he soon pursued, and he would make movies and show them at school, to great praise from the audience. Does this sound like the life and times of Steven Spielberg?This is a very, very long movie, and a great deal of the movie's runtime is made up by Sammy making movies, and then showing them to family and friends. Why this takes up so much screen time is beyond reason, as this does not contribute to the film in any way. Cool, we understand, he's making movies at a young age, but do we actually want to see everything of what he does? Just a hint of it would have sufficed. We get the picture.Judd Hirsch stars as Mitzi's uncle, Boris, whom her deceased mother warned her against in a dream. I was expecting so much from this character - especially also since Judd Hirsch received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor - but he was in this long film for only about 10 minutes and all he did was talk to Sammy. That's it! When he left the next morning, he was never seen again. What was the point? The film would not have played out any differently had this character not been in the movie at all.When the family moved to California and Sam was being bullied at school, I completely lost interest. It felt like a completely different movie and even the narration transitioned from interesting drama to uninteresting comedy - complete with religious blasphemy. What the hell?The most interesting characters with the promise of intrigue, were Mitzi and Bennie. No offense, Mr Spielberg, but the film had the potential to take so many interesting turns. Instead, the final act was primarily aimed at a teen demographic, and an uninteresting one at that. The horizon was in the middle. (If you've seen the movie, you'll know what this means).Yes, the performances were very good, and 'The Fabelmans' is beautifully filmed. Unfortunately, it was just way overlong, and ultimately a bit boring towards the end.","13 December 2022","2/10",NA
" Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)","Hard to care enough to finish watching it","Rob-O-Cop","I struggled to get through this film. It was just a rehash of the first film, and tired 'magical natives' tropes, offering nothing in the way of insight and intelligence. The usual bang bang explosions were there but does anyone really care to watch 3 hours of video game like action when you're not even a player?The much talked about visuals were fine, but so 'ten years ago', when we cared about stuff like CGI. Now we're seen it all and this is fine but nothing special.This film missed the boat by a decade and in that decade they couldn't hire themselves a writer to fit in some semblance of substance and meaning for a 2023 audience. A wasted effort and a waste of our time and someone's money.","29 December 2022","3/10",NA
" Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is","fraser-simons","Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?","29 January 2023","6/10",NA
" Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)","Messy and Inconsistent Plot Points, Over bloated With Teen Melodrama, But Pretty Visuals","dommercaldi","There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through painful dialog scenes.","16 December 2022","4/10",NA

But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go.

Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...","16 December 2022","7/10",NA
" Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story.","Paragon240","Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.","18 December 2022","6/10",NA

Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals..

With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

" Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)","Story and especially the dialogue is awful.","the-n","It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","16 December 2022","3/10",NA

" Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)","Bro, The only thing it nails is how pretty it is","fraser-simons","Pros:
1. For the most part, the movie has exceptional visuals and produces some stunning scenes, especially in the water. This film definitely serves as a love letter from James Cameron (Director) to the ocean.2. There are some touching scenes when it came to Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) caring for their family, and teaching them to care for each other.3. There are some entertaining action sequences that are engaging.4. The strong emphasis on family, and the importance to said family, is refreshing and a positive message to take away.Cons:
1. Plot-wise, this film was pretty much a rehashing of the first one as the evil humans come to conquer Pandora, but are beaten back by the virtuous Na'vi's.2. The run-time is far too long, and the script definitely isn't expansive enough to effectively fill out the 3 hour runtime. At least an hour could have been shaved off, especially with the boring teen-melodrama between the Jake's kids and the water tribes' kids.3. There are moments where the animation looks a little janky.4. Jack Champion (Spider) cannot act, and his character is both annoying and pointless. Spider just exists as a weak conduit to humanise Quaritch.5. Quaritch (Stephen Lang) and his marines are supposedly deadly and well-trained, but they pretty much lose every conflict, no matter how big or small, that they're engaged in. Moreover, the whole point of them coming back to Pandora as Na'vi was to infiltrate the world and get closer to Jake to kill him. However, they retain their marine get-up and weapons (which makes them stick out like a sore thumb), and their tactics used to flush Jake out, consists of them laying siege to Na'vi villages, torturing and killing the villagers, and then setting said villages aflame.6. Jake is depicted as virtuous and brave as he decides to leave the forest to protect his people from Quaritch, but he has no problem in seeking sanctuary with the water people and putting them in danger. He just saves one people at the expense of others.7. It seems almost every drama and conflict is initiated by Neteyam (Jamie Flatters) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton) disobeying Jake. It quickly becomes a tired and overused plot device to move the story along.8. The pro-environmental message is far too preachy and in your face. It also lacks subtlety in presentation like the anti-colonial messaging in the first movie.9. There's no nuance at all. The humans, who have actually travelled to Pandora in order to seek survival for humans, are portrayed as unequivocally evil, polluting and selfish, whereas the Na'vi are noble, courageous and in touch with nature. A deservedly more balanced viewing of the motivations of the humans could have added a lot more depth and intrigue into the story.10. This film ret-cons one of the most interesting plot points of the first movie, wherein the humans needed to link their live bodies to a machine which would transfer their consciousness to a Na'vi avatar. In this film however, it's revealed that humans have invented a microchip which allows them to upload their thoughts, emotions and personality traits to it. This not only now makes their second invasion of Pandora redundant as they're effectively immortal now, but it removes a big source of tension that the first movie had when Jake's human body was being hunted down by Quaritch. Moreover, as established in this film, they had invented this technology during the timeline of the first movie, so why didn't they use it?","29 January 2023","6/10",NA

But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI.

With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

" Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)","Story and especially the dialogue is awful.","the-n","It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas.

But thats not what people going in to watch the movie would want to see in a 3 hr movie.The action starts out at the beginning and in the end with detailsed description of the life of the Naavi comprising the major chunk of the film in the middle.Personally I was unable to sit through the movie in one go. Finished it in 3 sittings while skipping through many scenes I felt were totally unnecessary.","15 December 2022","6/10",NA

Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...","16 December 2022","7/10",NA
" Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)","Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor's footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story.","Paragon240","Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James Cameron and starring Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting, and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle, but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less originality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would give it 3/10 stars.","18 December 2022","6/10",NA
" Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)","I wanted to love..but there is no magic in this one","garabedian123","I saw the first one which was fantastic.

One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real.

" Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)","Empty beauty","alfredvankuik","Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!To watch this movie in cinemas and experience it is an one time opportunity in life, provided you can bear the portions which makes you feel like sitting inside a boring science class...","17 February 2023","5/10",NA

With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

" Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)","Story and especially the dialogue is awful.","the-n","It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.","16 December 2022","3/10",NA
" Decision to Leave (2022)","In Mist, I Walk Alone","ilpohirvonen","The early films of Park Chan-wook such as ""Joint Security Area"" (Gongdong gyeongbi guyeok JSA, 2000) and the so-called ""Vengeance trilogy"" - ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" (Boksuneun naui geot, 2002), ""Oldboy"" (Oldeuboi, 2003), and ""Lady Vengeance"" (Chinjeolhan geumjassi, 2005) - brought South-Korean cinema to western awareness and made Park an acclaimed auteur of world cinema. The trademarks of Park's films, which have sometimes seemed to become equivalent with the reputation of South-Korean cinema in general, are shocking violence, the eccentric portrayal of love, and complex narratives that employ surprising twists. The latest film from the director probably will not disappoint the dedicated global audience of such films, but ""Decision to Leave"" (Heojil kyolshim, 2022) is also something much more.Hae-jun (Park Hae-il) is a married police officer who suffers from insomnia as he keeps driving between two cities on misty roads. His work is in Busan, but his wife (played by Jung Yi-seo) awaits him in Ipo. When a businessman dies in what seems to be a mountain climbing accident, the police immediately pick up the businessman's Chinese wife Seo-rae (Tang Wei) as a primary suspect. The case seems clear to most, but Hae-jun's feelings for Seo-rae cloud his vision and judgment. In typical Park fashion, the situation quickly turns more complicated, Hae-jun's feelings become obsessive, and soon there seems to be no way out from the mist of emotions.There is a touch of Masumura's ""A Wife Confesses"" (1961) and, obviously, Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" (1958) in the film's premise, but Park has stated that ""Decision to Leave"" was in fact inspired by a Korean love song ""Angae"" (or ""Mist"") sung by Jung Hoon Hee in the 1960's. In the song, someone, who has lost their lover in the past, gets lost in the fog. We speak of ""brain fog"" or ""clouding of consciousness"" when describing the experience of indecisiveness and lack of focus, which are also signs of depression. Hae-jun is not necessarily clinically depressed, though his compassionate if a bit over-caring wife is concerned. After all, Hae-jun, a middle-aged man, belongs to a high-risk group. His wife thinks that Hae-jun needs violence and death in order to be happy, but the cop, who has dedicated a wall in his Busan flat to unsolved cases, does not seem jovial. Hae-jun needs his job or, more specifically, the attempts at solving mysteries to feel a sense of meaning in his life. This is the reason he initially falls for Seo-rae; she would fit perfectly on his wall of unsolved cases. She is a walking enigma.Alongside Hae-jun, the spectator must constantly guess whether Seo-rae is leading the cop on or not. Some of Seo-rae's behaviours, actions, and decisions may remain a bit unconvincing, which casts a faint shadow of implausibility to the film. On the other hand, the inability to fully grasp the character fits this film like a glove. An additional air of mystery is added to the character for the simple reason that she is Chinese. Since Seo-rae does not speak perfect Korean, she and Hae-jun must occasionally rely on apps on their smart phones for translation. As is well known, of course, things get lost in translation. And the multiple screens between them are not helping. In the end, the spectator is -- just like Hae-jun -- left incapable of having the final verdict on Seo-rae, this ephemeral character in the foggy landscape.Communication is thus clouded not just between characters but also the film's narration and the spectator. Both Park's style and narration obfuscate the sense of space and time. The complex plot is told in a fast pace, and narration keeps jumping back-and-forth between scenes, many of which have been executed with unprecedented innovation. For just one example, there is a scene where Park is able to combine Hae-jun in bed with his wife, him staring at mold on the corner of their wall, Seo-rae watching a Korean soap opera, and x-ray images related to the crime. Even if Hae-jun and Seo-rae were in different places in different times, Park constantly cuts their looks together. As a result, there is this continuous impression of a gaze that defies dimensions of space and time in the poetic space of the film. By means of editing, Park creates a luring kaleidoscope of ambivalent emotions. At times, this formal approach might make the following of the story a little challenging for the spectator, but the facts of the story do not in the end seem to matter that much. The atmosphere of Park's neo-noir melodrama is clouded by a brain fog in which it is difficult to concentrate and make decisions.Although ""Decision to Leave"" treads on familiar terrain for Park, as a film about love and obsession, I must say that I enjoyed it more than any other film from him. Even with his best films, I have always found Park's complicated narratives and his shocking violence somewhat self-deliberate, self-indulgent, and a bit bloated. Here, there are less gimmicks, and the film just feels more earnest, even though it is still a complex story. Given that ""Decision to Leave"" resembles ""Vertigo"", some might have presumptions regarding Park's eroticism, which invaded his previous film ""The Handmaiden"" (Ah-ga-ssi, 2016), but such reservations are unfounded. Curiously, ""Decision to Leave"" holds back in its portrayal of romance and erotic tension. In the film's most intimate scene, Hae-jun and Seo-rae exchange a bit of lip balm. ""Decision to Leave"" may not persuade completely, but it is still, to my mind, Park's most intriguing work. Form and content merge into a hazy cloud of fog which one finds difficult to leave behind.","17 November 2022","7/10",NA

" Decision to Leave (2022)","I didn't buy the love story - and without that the film has little to fall back on","jtindahouse","When you direct a film as good as 'Oldboy' early in your career I suspect it is a blessing and a curse. Park Chan-wook directed one of the greatest films of all time back in 2003. That's got to feel pretty good. The problem is that everything you produce after that is going to be compared to that masterpiece - be it right or wrong to do so.It can go the other way too of course, where you make a mediocre film but people know what you're capable of and so give you credit for intending things that weren't actually there. I wonder if a bit of that happened with 'Decision to Leave'. I'm not seeing what other people seem to have found in this one.The problem that I found with 'Decision to Leave' is that it heavily relies on you buying into the relationship between the two leads - and I simply didn't. I saw no chemistry and nothing else to sell it. Without that working this is an arduous 2 hours 20 minutes.The film is quite a complex as well. There is a lot of subtlety and jarring editing. I think it's a film that would get better with every watch, however I didn't enjoy it enough the first time around to do that. 5/10.","4 September 2022","5/10",NA
" Decision to Leave (2022)","Is it crime, is it romance ..... or is it both?","frankde-jong","""Decision to leave"" is a film with a very complicated plot, and I am not sure I really understand every twist of it. There is an alibi that doesn't seem so waterproof after all when you consider the possibility of manipulating the cellphone of an old lady. There is a scene in which I was not sure if it portrayed (film)reality or just an hypothetical possibility the detective was thinking about.The good news is I think that you don't have to understand 100% of the plot to grasp the essence of the movie. The essence is that the film is a mixture of crime and romance, a detective falling in love with his suspect.Director Park Chan Wook has made violent films (""Oldboy"", 2003) and sensual flms (""The handmaiden"", 2016). ""Decision to leave"" is both, but in a more subdued manner than in the rest of his oeuvre. In an early scene the detective and his suspect have had their first interrogation and at the end of it they seem more accustomed to each other than a couple after 15 years of marriage.Detective Hea Jun (Park Hae Il) does not sleep well and so the association with ""Insomnia"" (1997, Erik Skjoldbjærg & 2002, Christopher Nolan) is quickly made. An association that becomes even stronger due to the foggy weather in some parts of the movie. Maybe some Dutch viewers (as the writer of this review) have also thought of ""The 4th man"" (1983, Paul Verhoeven) about a woman who's husbands all mysteriously die. The difference is however that in ""Decision to leave"" the suspicion is there from the first moment on, while in ""The 4th man"" it only gradually arises.""Decision to leave"" is beautifully shot. I already mentioned the foggy weather, but also the interior scenes are sometimes beautifully framed. Apart from that there are some shots in which eyes are very prominent, indicating that this is not a movie about action but about see and be seen.","26 November 2022","8/10",NA
" Decision to Leave (2022)","One of the best films of 2022","paul-allaer","As ""Decision To Leave"" (2022 release from South Korea; 139 min) opens, the body of a mountain climber is found. Was he pushed or did he slip? Detective Hae-Jun leads the investigation of this ""unaccountable death without witnesses"", and his first target is the surviving wife, Seo-Rae, an emigrant from China without much outward signs of any grief... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from writer-producer-director. Park Chan-wook, who previously brought us ""The Handmaiden"" and ""Stoker"", among others. Here he brings us what at first appears to be a murder mystery, but it isn't long before the movie morphs into something different altogether. The movie is super plot-heavy so the less said about it, the better. Just watch! I will say that the movie's overall tone and atmosphere is transfixing from start to finish. The photography on location in Korea (thankfully staying away from the usual suspect Seoul) is outstanding. But in the end it's all about the movie's powerful storytelling, a trademark of many of Park's previous films.""Decision To Leave"" premiered at this year's Cannes film festival to immediate critical acclaim (and Park winning the festival's ""Best Director""). The movie is currently rated 94% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and for good reason, I am already going on record that this film without a doubt will get a ""Best Foreign Film"" Oscar nomination. The movie opened at my local arthouse theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at on the day after Thanksgiving was attended so-so (I counted 10 people including myself). I can only hope that as word of mouth gets around, along with the expected year-end award nominations coming out, this will garner wider attendance. If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign film that starts out as a murder mystery but evolves into something else altogether, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.","29 October 2022","8/10",NA
" Decision to Leave (2022)","As a huge Park Chan-wook fan, I am immensely disappointed","FeastMode","I found out about this movie two days ago. I didn't watch a trailer or read what it's about. On Park Chan-wook's name alone, I drove 45 minutes to see it opening night in the only theater showing it in Chicago. Why? Because he is a top 3 director for me with only Nolan and Fincher ahead of him. Oldboy is in my all-time top ten.With Decision to Leave, you can see Park's trademark style and technique. The technical aspects are great and there are some beautiful shots. But this movie does not come close to the ones I love.The movie is extremely boring. It doesn't have enough substance to warrant its runtime. I compare it to The Handmaiden, which is longer and almost entirely talking. But I love every moment and was never bored. It's filled with story and takes you on a journey.Decision to Leave made me want the movie to hurry up and finish. And when it did, I felt fully unsatisfied.

" Decision to Leave (2022)","A different style than North American neo-noir, which adds interest","steiner-sam","By the description alone, you may walk into Decision to Leave expecting Park Chan-Wook's Basic Instinct, but what you'll get is Park Chan-Wook's In the Mood for Love, an every-frame-a-painting anti-erotic romance between two lovers held together by a messed up situation, while also being a true-to-form noir film with less setup and payoff but more poetic justice than Chinatown, in Park's least horny film to date. The film centers around an unhappily married police detective put to work on a crime he finds himself not wanting to solve, as he investigates the movie's femme fatale for the murder of her husband, while attempting to work out his uncontrollable attraction to her, forcing both of them to ask themselves how romance can survive when hope for a future together depends upon them leaving the past unresolved. It's a mystery that Park unpacks with uncharacteristic restraint, if only because its ultimate payoff is more of a sinking realization than the kind of sudden bombshell often detonated at the end of his earlier films, requires these characters to remain firmly in the real world, where their adult longings will face adult consequences, though toning down the heightened, wildly over-the-top situations and conclusions from a typical Park fare does not change the fact that the storytelling here, both in its writing and visuals, is done with more precision than anything else he's made so far. Beginning at the sensuous first interrogation scene, which is hardly the first time in a film where an interrogation is framed as an act of seduction, it isn't the potential for sex that gets things moving (like Basic Instinct) as their very obvious affair remains unconsummated, but instead, we're given two unhappy people worming themselves into each other's minds, like faint whispers that may help them finally sleep.","17 September 2022","8/10",NA
" Decision to Leave (2022)","Park Chan Wook's In the Mood for Love","bulgerpaul","From the director of Oldboy & The Handmaiden comes a new crime mystery that's successful in sustaining our interest & investment in the whole outcome by keeping alive its sense of doubts & hints of darkness but it is also too drawn out & long-winded to leave a lasting impression. More a romance disguised as police procedural, Decision to Leave is a story of unrequited love, regret, longing & reminiscence.Co-written & directed by Park Chan-wook (Joint Security Area & Thirst), the story concerns a police detective who falls for a mysterious widow who happens to be the prime suspect of his latest murder investigation. The plot has multitudes of layers to it and is narrated in ways that requires closer inspection and while the technical mastery is top-notch, the film is surprisingly missing the immersive quality of his best works.The central romance plays its own tricks amidst all the secrecy & revelations that surface every now n then and a few scenes even manage to stand out but the film's intentions remain shaded despite never losing its intrigue. Tang Wei plays the femme fatale with an enigma & allure that's as captivating as it is compelling and she is finely supported by Park Hae-il who fittingly renders his role of the insomniac cop unsettled by his attraction to her.Overall, Decision to Leave fascinates & frustrates in equal measure with its confusing narrative, unpredictable characters, discursive detours, tedious pace and a runtime that's severely felt. The drama has a more ruminative flair to it and the two lead performances steer it rather wonderfully. And even though the film as a whole may unravel more on subsequent viewings, it is suffice to say for now that Park Chan-wook's latest is more or less an underwhelming dud.","17 August 2022","9/10",NA

" Decision to Leave (2022)","I didn't buy the love story - and without that the film has little to fall back on","jtindahouse","When you direct a film as good as 'Oldboy' early in your career I suspect it is a blessing and a curse. Park Chan-wook directed one of the greatest films of all time back in 2003. That's got to feel pretty good. The problem is that everything you produce after that is going to be compared to that masterpiece - be it right or wrong to do so.It can go the other way too of course, where you make a mediocre film but people know what you're capable of and so give you credit for intending things that weren't actually there. I wonder if a bit of that happened with 'Decision to Leave'. I'm not seeing what other people seem to have found in this one.The problem that I found with 'Decision to Leave' is that it heavily relies on you buying into the relationship between the two leads - and I simply didn't. I saw no chemistry and nothing else to sell it. Without that working this is an arduous 2 hours 20 minutes.The film is quite a complex as well. There is a lot of subtlety and jarring editing. I think it's a film that would get better with every watch, however I didn't enjoy it enough the first time around to do that. 5/10.","4 September 2022","5/10",NA
" Decision to Leave (2022)","Is it crime, is it romance ..... or is it both?","frankde-jong","""Decision to leave"" is a film with a very complicated plot, and I am not sure I really understand every twist of it. There is an alibi that doesn't seem so waterproof after all when you consider the possibility of manipulating the cellphone of an old lady. There is a scene in which I was not sure if it portrayed (film)reality or just an hypothetical possibility the detective was thinking about.The good news is I think that you don't have to understand 100% of the plot to grasp the essence of the movie. The essence is that the film is a mixture of crime and romance, a detective falling in love with his suspect.Director Park Chan Wook has made violent films (""Oldboy"", 2003) and sensual flms (""The handmaiden"", 2016). ""Decision to leave"" is both, but in a more subdued manner than in the rest of his oeuvre. In an early scene the detective and his suspect have had their first interrogation and at the end of it they seem more accustomed to each other than a couple after 15 years of marriage.Detective Hea Jun (Park Hae Il) does not sleep well and so the association with ""Insomnia"" (1997, Erik Skjoldbjærg & 2002, Christopher Nolan) is quickly made. An association that becomes even stronger due to the foggy weather in some parts of the movie. Maybe some Dutch viewers (as the writer of this review) have also thought of ""The 4th man"" (1983, Paul Verhoeven) about a woman who's husbands all mysteriously die. The difference is however that in ""Decision to leave"" the suspicion is there from the first moment on, while in ""The 4th man"" it only gradually arises.""Decision to leave"" is beautifully shot. I already mentioned the foggy weather, but also the interior scenes are sometimes beautifully framed. Apart from that there are some shots in which eyes are very prominent, indicating that this is not a movie about action but about see and be seen.","26 November 2022","8/10",NA
" Decision to Leave (2022)","One of the best films of 2022","paul-allaer","As ""Decision To Leave"" (2022 release from South Korea; 139 min) opens, the body of a mountain climber is found. Was he pushed or did he slip? Detective Hae-Jun leads the investigation of this ""unaccountable death without witnesses"", and his first target is the surviving wife, Seo-Rae, an emigrant from China without much outward signs of any grief... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from writer-producer-director. Park Chan-wook, who previously brought us ""The Handmaiden"" and ""Stoker"", among others. Here he brings us what at first appears to be a murder mystery, but it isn't long before the movie morphs into something different altogether. The movie is super plot-heavy so the less said about it, the better. Just watch! I will say that the movie's overall tone and atmosphere is transfixing from start to finish. The photography on location in Korea (thankfully staying away from the usual suspect Seoul) is outstanding. But in the end it's all about the movie's powerful storytelling, a trademark of many of Park's previous films.""Decision To Leave"" premiered at this year's Cannes film festival to immediate critical acclaim (and Park winning the festival's ""Best Director""). The movie is currently rated 94% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and for good reason, I am already going on record that this film without a doubt will get a ""Best Foreign Film"" Oscar nomination. The movie opened at my local arthouse theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at on the day after Thanksgiving was attended so-so (I counted 10 people including myself). I can only hope that as word of mouth gets around, along with the expected year-end award nominations coming out, this will garner wider attendance.

" Decision to Leave (2022)","As a huge Park Chan-wook fan, I am immensely disappointed","FeastMode","I found out about this movie two days ago. I didn't watch a trailer or read what it's about. On Park Chan-wook's name alone, I drove 45 minutes to see it opening night in the only theater showing it in Chicago. Why? Because he is a top 3 director for me with only Nolan and Fincher ahead of him. Oldboy is in my all-time top ten.With Decision to Leave, you can see Park's trademark style and technique. The technical aspects are great and there are some beautiful shots. But this movie does not come close to the ones I love.The movie is extremely boring. It doesn't have enough substance to warrant its runtime. I compare it to The Handmaiden, which is longer and almost entirely talking. But I love every moment and was never bored.

" Decision to Leave (2022)","A different style than North American neo-noir, which adds interest","steiner-sam","By the description alone, you may walk into Decision to Leave expecting Park Chan-Wook's Basic Instinct, but what you'll get is Park Chan-Wook's In the Mood for Love, an every-frame-a-painting anti-erotic romance between two lovers held together by a messed up situation, while also being a true-to-form noir film with less setup and payoff but more poetic justice than Chinatown, in Park's least horny film to date. The film centers around an unhappily married police detective put to work on a crime he finds himself not wanting to solve, as he investigates the movie's femme fatale for the murder of her husband, while attempting to work out his uncontrollable attraction to her, forcing both of them to ask themselves how romance can survive when hope for a future together depends upon them leaving the past unresolved. It's a mystery that Park unpacks with uncharacteristic restraint, if only because its ultimate payoff is more of a sinking realization than the kind of sudden bombshell often detonated at the end of his earlier films, requires these characters to remain firmly in the real world, where their adult longings will face adult consequences, though toning down the heightened, wildly over-the-top situations and conclusions from a typical Park fare does not change the fact that the storytelling here, both in its writing and visuals, is done with more precision than anything else he's made so far. Beginning at the sensuous first interrogation scene, which is hardly the first time in a film where an interrogation is framed as an act of seduction, it isn't the potential for sex that gets things moving (like Basic Instinct) as their very obvious affair remains unconsummated, but instead, we're given two unhappy people worming themselves into each other's minds, like faint whispers that may help them finally sleep.","17 September 2022","8/10",NA
" Decision to Leave (2022)","Park Chan Wook's In the Mood for Love","bulgerpaul","From the director of Oldboy & The Handmaiden comes a new crime mystery that's successful in sustaining our interest & investment in the whole outcome by keeping alive its sense of doubts & hints of darkness but it is also too drawn out & long-winded to leave a lasting impression. More a romance disguised as police procedural, Decision to Leave is a story of unrequited love, regret, longing & reminiscence.Co-written & directed by Park Chan-wook (Joint Security Area & Thirst), the story concerns a police detective who falls for a mysterious widow who happens to be the prime suspect of his latest murder investigation. The plot has multitudes of layers to it and is narrated in ways that requires closer inspection and while the technical mastery is top-notch, the film is surprisingly missing the immersive quality of his best works.The central romance plays its own tricks amidst all the secrecy & revelations that surface every now n then and a few scenes even manage to stand out but the film's intentions remain shaded despite never losing its intrigue. Tang Wei plays the femme fatale with an enigma & allure that's as captivating as it is compelling and she is finely supported by Park Hae-il who fittingly renders his role of the insomniac cop unsettled by his attraction to her.Overall, Decision to Leave fascinates & frustrates in equal measure with its confusing narrative, unpredictable characters, discursive detours, tedious pace and a runtime that's severely felt. The drama has a more ruminative flair to it and the two lead performances steer it rather wonderfully. And even though the film as a whole may unravel more on subsequent viewings, it is suffice to say for now that Park Chan-wook's latest is more or less an underwhelming dud.","17 August 2022","9/10",NA

" Decision to Leave (2022)","In Mist, I Walk Alone","ilpohirvonen","The early films of Park Chan-wook such as ""Joint Security Area"" (Gongdong gyeongbi guyeok JSA, 2000) and the so-called ""Vengeance trilogy"" - ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" (Boksuneun naui geot, 2002), ""Oldboy"" (Oldeuboi, 2003), and ""Lady Vengeance"" (Chinjeolhan geumjassi, 2005) - brought South-Korean cinema to western awareness and made Park an acclaimed auteur of world cinema. The trademarks of Park's films, which have sometimes seemed to become equivalent with the reputation of South-Korean cinema in general, are shocking violence, the eccentric portrayal of love, and complex narratives that employ surprising twists. The latest film from the director probably will not disappoint the dedicated global audience of such films, but ""Decision to Leave"" (Heojil kyolshim, 2022) is also something much more.Hae-jun (Park Hae-il) is a married police officer who suffers from insomnia as he keeps driving between two cities on misty roads. His work is in Busan, but his wife (played by Jung Yi-seo) awaits him in Ipo. When a businessman dies in what seems to be a mountain climbing accident, the police immediately pick up the businessman's Chinese wife Seo-rae (Tang Wei) as a primary suspect. The case seems clear to most, but Hae-jun's feelings for Seo-rae cloud his vision and judgment. In typical Park fashion, the situation quickly turns more complicated, Hae-jun's feelings become obsessive, and soon there seems to be no way out from the mist of emotions.There is a touch of Masumura's ""A Wife Confesses"" (1961) and, obviously, Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" (1958) in the film's premise, but Park has stated that ""Decision to Leave"" was in fact inspired by a Korean love song ""Angae"" (or ""Mist"") sung by Jung Hoon Hee in the 1960's. In the song, someone, who has lost their lover in the past, gets lost in the fog. We speak of ""brain fog"" or ""clouding of consciousness"" when describing the experience of indecisiveness and lack of focus, which are also signs of depression. Hae-jun is not necessarily clinically depressed, though his compassionate if a bit over-caring wife is concerned. After all, Hae-jun, a middle-aged man, belongs to a high-risk group. His wife thinks that Hae-jun needs violence and death in order to be happy, but the cop, who has dedicated a wall in his Busan flat to unsolved cases, does not seem jovial. Hae-jun needs his job or, more specifically, the attempts at solving mysteries to feel a sense of meaning in his life. This is the reason he initially falls for Seo-rae; she would fit perfectly on his wall of unsolved cases. She is a walking enigma.Alongside Hae-jun, the spectator must constantly guess whether Seo-rae is leading the cop on or not. Some of Seo-rae's behaviours, actions, and decisions may remain a bit unconvincing, which casts a faint shadow of implausibility to the film. On the other hand, the inability to fully grasp the character fits this film like a glove. An additional air of mystery is added to the character for the simple reason that she is Chinese. Since Seo-rae does not speak perfect Korean, she and Hae-jun must occasionally rely on apps on their smart phones for translation. As is well known, of course, things get lost in translation. And the multiple screens between them are not helping. In the end, the spectator is -- just like Hae-jun -- left incapable of having the final verdict on Seo-rae, this ephemeral character in the foggy landscape.Communication is thus clouded not just between characters but also the film's narration and the spectator. Both Park's style and narration obfuscate the sense of space and time. The complex plot is told in a fast pace, and narration keeps jumping back-and-forth between scenes, many of which have been executed with unprecedented innovation. For just one example, there is a scene where Park is able to combine Hae-jun in bed with his wife, him staring at mold on the corner of their wall, Seo-rae watching a Korean soap opera, and x-ray images related to the crime. Even if Hae-jun and Seo-rae were in different places in different times, Park constantly cuts their looks together. As a result, there is this continuous impression of a gaze that defies dimensions of space and time in the poetic space of the film. By means of editing, Park creates a luring kaleidoscope of ambivalent emotions. At times, this formal approach might make the following of the story a little challenging for the spectator, but the facts of the story do not in the end seem to matter that much. The atmosphere of Park's neo-noir melodrama is clouded by a brain fog in which it is difficult to concentrate and make decisions.Although ""Decision to Leave"" treads on familiar terrain for Park, as a film about love and obsession, I must say that I enjoyed it more than any other film from him. Even with his best films, I have always found Park's complicated narratives and his shocking violence somewhat self-deliberate, self-indulgent, and a bit bloated. Here, there are less gimmicks, and the film just feels more earnest, even though it is still a complex story. Given that ""Decision to Leave"" resembles ""Vertigo"", some might have presumptions regarding Park's eroticism, which invaded his previous film ""The Handmaiden"" (Ah-ga-ssi, 2016), but such reservations are unfounded. Curiously, ""Decision to Leave"" holds back in its portrayal of romance and erotic tension. In the film's most intimate scene, Hae-jun and Seo-rae exchange a bit of lip balm. ""Decision to Leave"" may not persuade completely, but it is still, to my mind, Park's most intriguing work. Form and content merge into a hazy cloud of fog which one finds difficult to leave behind.","17 November 2022","7/10",NA

We speak of ""brain fog"" or ""clouding of consciousness"" when describing the experience of indecisiveness and lack of focus, which are also signs of depression. Hae-jun is not necessarily clinically depressed, though his compassionate if a bit over-caring wife is concerned. After all, Hae-jun, a middle-aged man, belongs to a high-risk group. His wife thinks that Hae-jun needs violence and death in order to be happy, but the cop, who has dedicated a wall in his Busan flat to unsolved cases, does not seem jovial. Hae-jun needs his job or, more specifically, the attempts at solving mysteries to feel a sense of meaning in his life. This is the reason he initially falls for Seo-rae; she would fit perfectly on his wall of unsolved cases. She is a walking enigma.Alongside Hae-jun, the spectator must constantly guess whether Seo-rae is leading the cop on or not. Some of Seo-rae's behaviours, actions, and decisions may remain a bit unconvincing, which casts a faint shadow of implausibility to the film. On the other hand, the inability to fully grasp the character fits this film like a glove. An additional air of mystery is added to the character for the simple reason that she is Chinese. Since Seo-rae does not speak perfect Korean, she and Hae-jun must occasionally rely on apps on their smart phones for translation. As is well known, of course, things get lost in translation. And the multiple screens between them are not helping. In the end, the spectator is -- just like Hae-jun -- left incapable of having the final verdict on Seo-rae, this ephemeral character in the foggy landscape.Communication is thus clouded not just between characters but also the film's narration and the spectator. Both Park's style and narration obfuscate the sense of space and time. The complex plot is told in a fast pace, and narration keeps jumping back-and-forth between scenes, many of which have been executed with unprecedented innovation. For just one example, there is a scene where Park is able to combine Hae-jun in bed with his wife, him staring at mold on the corner of their wall, Seo-rae watching a Korean soap opera, and x-ray images related to the crime. Even if Hae-jun and Seo-rae were in different places in different times, Park constantly cuts their looks together. As a result, there is this continuous impression of a gaze that defies dimensions of space and time in the poetic space of the film. By means of editing, Park creates a luring kaleidoscope of ambivalent emotions. At times, this formal approach might make the following of the story a little challenging for the spectator, but the facts of the story do not in the end seem to matter that much. The atmosphere of Park's neo-noir melodrama is clouded by a brain fog in which it is difficult to concentrate and make decisions.Although ""Decision to Leave"" treads on familiar terrain for Park, as a film about love and obsession, I must say that I enjoyed it more than any other film from him. Even with his best films, I have always found Park's complicated narratives and his shocking violence somewhat self-deliberate, self-indulgent, and a bit bloated. Here, there are less gimmicks, and the film just feels more earnest, even though it is still a complex story. Given that ""Decision to Leave"" resembles ""Vertigo"", some might have presumptions regarding Park's eroticism, which invaded his previous film ""The Handmaiden"" (Ah-ga-ssi, 2016), but such reservations are unfounded. Curiously, ""Decision to Leave"" holds back in its portrayal of romance and erotic tension. In the film's most intimate scene, Hae-jun and Seo-rae exchange a bit of lip balm. ""Decision to Leave"" may not persuade completely, but it is still, to my mind, Park's most intriguing work. Form and content merge into a hazy cloud of fog which one finds difficult to leave behind.","17 November 2022","7/10",NA

" Decision to Leave (2022)","I didn't buy the love story - and without that the film has little to fall back on","jtindahouse","When you direct a film as good as 'Oldboy' early in your career I suspect it is a blessing and a curse. Park Chan-wook directed one of the greatest films of all time back in 2003. That's got to feel pretty good. The problem is that everything you produce after that is going to be compared to that masterpiece - be it right or wrong to do so.It can go the other way too of course, where you make a mediocre film but people know what you're capable of and so give you credit for intending things that weren't actually there.

" Decision to Leave (2022)","Is it crime, is it romance ..... or is it both?","frankde-jong","""Decision to leave"" is a film with a very complicated plot, and I am not sure I really understand every twist of it. There is an alibi that doesn't seem so waterproof after all when you consider the possibility of manipulating the cellphone of an old lady. There is a scene in which I was not sure if it portrayed (film)reality or just an hypothetical possibility the detective was thinking about.The good news is I think that you don't have to understand 100% of the plot to grasp the essence of the movie. The essence is that the film is a mixture of crime and romance, a detective falling in love with his suspect.Director Park Chan Wook has made violent films (""Oldboy"", 2003) and sensual flms (""The handmaiden"", 2016). ""Decision to leave"" is both, but in a more subdued manner than in the rest of his oeuvre. In an early scene the detective and his suspect have had their first interrogation and at the end of it they seem more accustomed to each other than a couple after 15 years of marriage.Detective Hea Jun (Park Hae Il) does not sleep well and so the association with ""Insomnia"" (1997, Erik Skjoldbjærg & 2002, Christopher Nolan) is quickly made. An association that becomes even stronger due to the foggy weather in some parts of the movie. Maybe some Dutch viewers (as the writer of this review) have also thought of ""The 4th man"" (1983, Paul Verhoeven) about a woman who's husbands all mysteriously die. The difference is however that in ""Decision to leave"" the suspicion is there from the first moment on, while in ""The 4th man"" it only gradually arises.""Decision to leave"" is beautifully shot. I already mentioned the foggy weather, but also the interior scenes are sometimes beautifully framed. Apart from that there are some shots in which eyes are very prominent, indicating that this is not a movie about action but about see and be seen.","26 November 2022","8/10",NA

At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from writer-producer-director. Park Chan-wook, who previously brought us ""The Handmaiden"" and ""Stoker"", among others. Here he brings us what at first appears to be a murder mystery, but it isn't long before the movie morphs into something different altogether.

" Decision to Leave (2022)","A different style than North American neo-noir, which adds interest","steiner-sam","By the description alone, you may walk into Decision to Leave expecting Park Chan-Wook's Basic Instinct, but what you'll get is Park Chan-Wook's In the Mood for Love, an every-frame-a-painting anti-erotic romance between two lovers held together by a messed up situation, while also being a true-to-form noir film with less setup and payoff but more poetic justice than Chinatown, in Park's least horny film to date. The film centers around an unhappily married police detective put to work on a crime he finds himself not wanting to solve, as he investigates the movie's femme fatale for the murder of her husband, while attempting to work out his uncontrollable attraction to her, forcing both of them to ask themselves how romance can survive when hope for a future together depends upon them leaving the past unresolved. It's a mystery that Park unpacks with uncharacteristic restraint, if only because its ultimate payoff is more of a sinking realization than the kind of sudden bombshell often detonated at the end of his earlier films, requires these characters to remain firmly in the real world, where their adult longings will face adult consequences, though toning down the heightened, wildly over-the-top situations and conclusions from a typical Park fare does not change the fact that the storytelling here, both in its writing and visuals, is done with more precision than anything else he's made so far. Beginning at the sensuous first interrogation scene, which is hardly the first time in a film where an interrogation is framed as an act of seduction, it isn't the potential for sex that gets things moving (like Basic Instinct) as their very obvious affair remains unconsummated, but instead, we're given two unhappy people worming themselves into each other's minds, like faint whispers that may help them finally sleep.","17 September 2022","8/10",NA
" Decision to Leave (2022)","Park Chan Wook's In the Mood for Love","bulgerpaul","From the director of Oldboy & The Handmaiden comes a new crime mystery that's successful in sustaining our interest & investment in the whole outcome by keeping alive its sense of doubts & hints of darkness but it is also too drawn out & long-winded to leave a lasting impression. More a romance disguised as police procedural, Decision to Leave is a story of unrequited love, regret, longing & reminiscence.Co-written & directed by Park Chan-wook (Joint Security Area & Thirst), the story concerns a police detective who falls for a mysterious widow who happens to be the prime suspect of his latest murder investigation. The plot has multitudes of layers to it and is narrated in ways that requires closer inspection and while the technical mastery is top-notch, the film is surprisingly missing the immersive quality of his best works.The central romance plays its own tricks amidst all the secrecy & revelations that surface every now n then and a few scenes even manage to stand out but the film's intentions remain shaded despite never losing its intrigue. Tang Wei plays the femme fatale with an enigma & allure that's as captivating as it is compelling and she is finely supported by Park Hae-il who fittingly renders his role of the insomniac cop unsettled by his attraction to her.Overall, Decision to Leave fascinates & frustrates in equal measure with its confusing narrative, unpredictable characters, discursive detours, tedious pace and a runtime that's severely felt. The drama has a more ruminative flair to it and the two lead performances steer it rather wonderfully. And even though the film as a whole may unravel more on subsequent viewings, it is suffice to say for now that Park Chan-wook's latest is more or less an underwhelming dud.","17 August 2022","9/10",NA

" Decision to Leave (2022)","In Mist, I Walk Alone","ilpohirvonen","The early films of Park Chan-wook such as ""Joint Security Area"" (Gongdong gyeongbi guyeok JSA, 2000) and the so-called ""Vengeance trilogy"" - ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" (Boksuneun naui geot, 2002), ""Oldboy"" (Oldeuboi, 2003), and ""Lady Vengeance"" (Chinjeolhan geumjassi, 2005) - brought South-Korean cinema to western awareness and made Park an acclaimed auteur of world cinema. The trademarks of Park's films, which have sometimes seemed to become equivalent with the reputation of South-Korean cinema in general, are shocking violence, the eccentric portrayal of love, and complex narratives that employ surprising twists. The latest film from the director probably will not disappoint the dedicated global audience of such films, but ""Decision to Leave"" (Heojil kyolshim, 2022) is also something much more.Hae-jun (Park Hae-il) is a married police officer who suffers from insomnia as he keeps driving between two cities on misty roads. His work is in Busan, but his wife (played by Jung Yi-seo) awaits him in Ipo. When a businessman dies in what seems to be a mountain climbing accident, the police immediately pick up the businessman's Chinese wife Seo-rae (Tang Wei) as a primary suspect. The case seems clear to most, but Hae-jun's feelings for Seo-rae cloud his vision and judgment. In typical Park fashion, the situation quickly turns more complicated, Hae-jun's feelings become obsessive, and soon there seems to be no way out from the mist of emotions.There is a touch of Masumura's ""A Wife Confesses"" (1961) and, obviously, Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" (1958) in the film's premise, but Park has stated that ""Decision to Leave"" was in fact inspired by a Korean love song ""Angae"" (or ""Mist"") sung by Jung Hoon Hee in the 1960's.

More a romance disguised as police procedural, Decision to Leave is a story of unrequited love, regret, longing & reminiscence.Co-written & directed by Park Chan-wook (Joint Security Area & Thirst), the story concerns a police detective who falls for a mysterious widow who happens to be the prime suspect of his latest murder investigation. The plot has multitudes of layers to it and is narrated in ways that requires closer inspection and while the technical mastery is top-notch, the film is surprisingly missing the immersive quality of his best works.The central romance plays its own tricks amidst all the secrecy & revelations that surface every now n then and a few scenes even manage to stand out but the film's intentions remain shaded despite never losing its intrigue. Tang Wei plays the femme fatale with an enigma & allure that's as captivating as it is compelling and she is finely supported by Park Hae-il who fittingly renders his role of the insomniac cop unsettled by his attraction to her.Overall, Decision to Leave fascinates & frustrates in equal measure with its confusing narrative, unpredictable characters, discursive detours, tedious pace and a runtime that's severely felt. The drama has a more ruminative flair to it and the two lead performances steer it rather wonderfully. And even though the film as a whole may unravel more on subsequent viewings, it is suffice to say for now that Park Chan-wook's latest is more or less an underwhelming dud.","17 August 2022","9/10",NA
" Decision to Leave (2022)","Park Chan-Wook's Latest Fails To Live Up To The Hype","CinemaClown","My Rating : 8/10'Decision to Leave' is one hell of a ride - it's a lot of movie and with a runtime of 2 hours and 18 minutes there's lots of things going on - like a puzzle with elements of melodrama and violence, lots of humour to not get too in your face, essential for a dark slow-burn movie that's trying to create something interesting and innovative.This is a different type of a critique movie - it's more personal and not trying to be like 'Parasite' - this is more introverted and it's a beautiful love story given all the craziness - it's more a textbook movie than one which is open to reviews and interpretations.Sublime, ethereal with all the dark humour anyone could ever ask for. Highest Recommendation.","28 October 2022","8/10",NA
"The Menu (2022)","A dark comedy satire reflecting the nation today","redbeardceltic","The hype for The Menu intrigued me. The reviews celebrated its genius. So I had to see it. And when I sat in the theater and the credits began to roll, all o could say was, ""Huh?"" The Menu starts with Ready or Not vibes with a fish-out-of-water real-world character who ends up at a fancy dinner with a collection of high society foodies and critics. The trailer gave me expectations of cannibalism cult or Most Dangerous Game-type plots, but instead, nothing really happened. I think I understood what The Menu was trying to convey with its deeper meaning, but I still came up disappointed. Anya Taylor-Joy and the rest of the cast gave great performances, but there was little that really brought the movie together. Maybe the subversion of the cannibal or hunting expectation was the movie's brilliance? The Menu definitely tried to be clever, but whether it was or not might be open to interpretation.

"The Menu (2022)","🍲The Premise was Better Than the Actual Execution 🍛","DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed","I thought this movie was original, entertaining and very interesting. It has a deeper message about how the world looks today. The constant stress and pressure of performing and pleasing hard-to-please people. People who are spoiled, people who only care about money, people who take life for granted, and so on. This is what the characters in the film, the chef and the guests, represent. The guests represent the worst of us. Constantly feeling pressured about something that you actually think is fun, is no longer fun. That is why the chef has invited these very people to the restaurant. It is such people who have destroyed his passion, meaning and joy in life.

"The Menu (2022)","Nice Try, But the Satire Doesn't Land","evanston_dad","""The Menu"" offers a trailer spectacular enough to entice me to set foot in a physical movie theater for the first time in 3 years. Packed with both veteran and burgeoning actors and directed by Mark Mylod of ""Succession"" fame, this movie has all the goodies to entertain you and make you think at the same time, supposedly. It starts out well enough, introducing quirky mysterious characters starting with Elsa played by Hong Chau. I find her really captivating in this role, a perfect combo of politeness and menace. Why is she dressed like that? Then we meet the Chef who has an agenda that unravels through the perspective of Margot, played by the always-awesome Anya Taylor-Joy. Margot is us, wanting to expose the ridiculousness of it all. Yet herein lies the problem with the movie. Its effort as a biting satire turns into a confusing mess at the end.

"The Menu (2022)","Great satire","masonsaul","The Menu is a real treat. It will have you laughing while on the edge of your seat as it navigates you through a restaurant experience to remember.We are treated to a fantastic ensemble cast. Nicholas Hoult steals the show with a pitch perfect performance of a pretentious foodie. Fiennes is so wonderfully unhinged as the mysterious creator of the eponymous menu in a very layered role. Anya Taylor Joy as always is so watchable, providing such an easy way in for the audience. The writing gives them all such brilliant material which the whole cast executes with ease.The style and staging of the piece can't be faulted at all. It is precise, inventive, and so clean and polished which makes for a very visually appealing film.It must be said there are a few rough edges when it comes to the plot, and when you get down to the nuts and bolts the premise isn't necessarily groundbreaking. It is very on the nose at times and subtlety isn't exactly it's strong suit. However it manages to strike a well tuned balance between satire, comedy, and thriller which isn't an easy feat and is impressively managed here.With its sharp social observations and satire, clean style, and stellar performances, the Menu is a feast that you won't want to end.","20 November 2022","8/10",NA
"The Menu (2022)","Original, but ultimately unsatisfying fare.","Her-Excellency","Mark Mylod's ""The Menu"" is clearly a satire of a great many things--class, snobbishness, obsession, and the eating experience-in-general immediately spring to mind. While it certainly gets some awkward laughs and throws enough bizarre sight/character gags to live up to that satire moniker, it does so without one coherent, over-arcing message or a single character to really root for.For a very basic overview, ""The Menu"" follows Tyler (Nicholas Hoult) and Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy) as they embark on a lavish/expensive dining experience coordinated by master chef Slowik (Ralph Fiennes). As the courses progress and some weirdness--which quickly becomes deadly-serious--pop ups, it becomes apparent that this ""fine dining"" is anything but.To me, the glaring problem with ""The Menu"" was that it lacked any character I could really root for amidst the bizarre nature of the circumstances they are placed in. It certainly isn't the Chef himself or any of the other pretentious passengers, and clearly the protagonist is supposed to be Taylor-Joy's Margot. But even that character is difficult to root for in the beginning and suffers from some thematic irregularity as more about her is revealed. As such, it was difficult for me to become invested in this film when I couldn't find a ""way in"".I also believe that ""The Menu"" is very much a ""throw a bunch of themes at the wall to see what sticks"" sort of movie. There are a number of undercurrents running through the picture, but they are largely dangled in front of the audience before quickly moving on to the next one. There is no overall take-home message or thoroughfare to be found here.I can give ""The Menu"" 3-stars for at least being a competent production from a visual/tonal standpoint--but no more. Even if one accepts the spattering of ideas that constitute its plot, it may be difficult to find something (or someone) to make you truly care one way or another.","3 September 2023","6/10",NA

" Happening (2021)","Strong, decisive and immediate","gortx","Like it's lead character, Anne (Anamaria Vartolomei), Director Audrey Diwan's HAPPENING is direct, strong and decisive. Anne is a very promising literature student who finds herself pregnant after a fling with a visiting student. The place is France in the early 60s when having a procedure to abort a baby is strictly illegal. Her closest friends and doctor want nothing to do with her plans - especially, her doctor, who's very counsel could land him in jail.Diwan's adaptation of Annie Ernaux's novel feels immediate, adopting an almost you are there approach (the script was co-written by Diwan and a trio of other writers). While it's certainly not a documentary construct, it's very much a drama, but it feels real. Laurent Tangy's hand-held camera is like an intimate partner to Diwan's vision. The active tense title is very much on point here (the French title also translates into ""The Event"").Vartolomei is quite excellent. She is often the only character on screen and her performance never seems studied, simply inhabited. The others in the cast are always believable even if they don't have time to really develop. Anna Mouglalis is particularly memorable as the blunt Mme. Riviere, and legendary European actress Sandrinne Bonnaire is on hand as Anne's mother.HAPPENING gets quite explicit at times, but never feels in the least exploitative. The screenplay is also admirable in that it never preaches. Diwan follows her character on her own terms all the way through. It's a difficult movie, but a very worthy one.","2 February 2023","8/10",NA
" Happening (2021)","Gut-wrenching abortion drama, now more relevant than ever","paul-allaer","As ""Happening"" (2021 release from France; 100 min.) opens, it's some time in the early 1960s in France, and we are introduced to several young women, students at the local university, who are getting ready to go out on the town. One of them is Annie (or Anne). Then later, Annie goes to see a doctor as her period is late. The doctor informs her that she is pregnant, to Annie's shock. She asks the doctor ""to do something"" but he flat-out refuses, as abortion is illegal and carries a penalty in jail... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from French-Lebanese writer-director Audrey Diwan (""Losing It""). Here she brings the real life tale of what happens to a young woman in her early 20s who gets pregnant in a time and space where abortion is entirely illegal without any exceptions (France in the early 60s). Watch how Annie gets no support, zero, from anyone around her including doctors, family and friends, and even her lover. Watch how increasingly desperate Annie becomes as the weeks pass. Please note that some scenes are very difficult to watch. The US premiere of this film came at the 2022 Sundance film festival, just over a year ago, and mere months before the US Supreme Court overruled Re v. Wade, with the GOP subsequently enacting strict anti-abortion laws in multiple states. For shame. Do you want to go back more than half a century to the times when men in power decided that ""this isn't a woman's issue""? Welcome to the GOP of 2022! As a complete aside, this film is based on the book of the same name by acclaimed French author Annie Ernaux (born Duchesne), who just last year won the Nobel Prize in Literature.""Happening"" is currently rated 99% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and for good reason. It is a gut-wrenching abortion drama, now more relevant issue than ever. I had been clamoring to see this film, and finally it started streaming on Hulu just yesterday. I watched it right away. If you are in the mood for a top-notch if devastating abortion drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.","15 May 2022","8/10",NA
" Happening (2021)","A very direct title for a movie that pulls no punches.","subxerogravity","It's a movie that came out at the right place in the right time, it's about a girl in France during the 60s who needs an abortion but is engulf in a culture that made this action illegal. Oh wow! Where have I heard that story before?From a man's point a view this might sound insensitive, but this flick was horrifying. The horrible steps this woman had to take because she lived in a world that would not give her the proper medical procedure to have it done in a healthier environment, just made the whole thing feel like a horror movie. They held nothing back when it came to DIY method of how it's all done.I don't want to get too political, then again, it's not a coincidence this movie is in American theatres now.

Told from the point of view of the main character in close up and close quarters, it's a vivid journey, superbly written and directed by Audrey Diwan and with a stunning central portrayal by Annamaria Vartolomai.","28 August 2022","7/10",NA
" Happening (2021)","It's still happening.","Pjtaylor-96-138044","'Happening (2021)' may be set in 1963 in France, but it might as well be set in 2022 in America. With the recent passing of certain draconian laws, this period piece is more relevant than many of its modern-day counterparts. In fact, its period setting actually further compounds its poignance. Anyone tempted to view the backwards beliefs and legislations that plague not only its central character but, indirectly or otherwise, every other female character in the entire affair as a product of their time is either wilfully ignorant or set to have a very rude awakening when they turn on the news. Film has always been a great tool for empathy, offering a glimpse into the life of someone other than yourself. In many cases, it allows people to connect with the lived experiences of groups of people they're unlikely to ever even meet, let alone directly identify with. Watching someone, fictional or otherwise, undergo a struggle completely alien to yourself is something that, if approached with the right mindset, can widen your worldview and allow you to more easily understand those with vastly different lived experiences to that of your own. This movie does just that. It places you in the shoes of a quietly determined young student who becomes pregnant and does everything she can to obtain an abortion. For whatever reason, a woman's right to choose what happens with her own body is still a touchy subject. Here, though, it's rendered with such aplomb that it's almost hard to imagine even the most devout republican having an issue with the central character's decision. Actually, that's probably giving devout republicans too much credit. Regardless, the point still stands that the picture does an excellent job of putting you in the inconvenienced and isolated shoes of its protagonist. It does an excellent job at conveying the deep-rooted sense of betrayal that comes with everyone around you denying your right to choose what happens to you. Doctors become enemies, families become distant, friends become nothing more than faces in the crowd, and the future suddenly doesn't seem quite as bright as it used to. Despite this growing loneliness and desperation, the lead never loses her focus. She never questions her decision or, more importantly, that it's a decision she and she alone can make. Crucially, her pregnancy isn't the result of incest or a rape and there's no indication that her baby will be unhealthy or that their birth would present a danger to her own life. Instead, her pregnancy is the only thing it should need to be in order for an abortion to be administered: unwanted. By doing this, it argues for universal bodily autonomy and presents the case that abortion is a right regardless of circumstance. The protagonist even says she'd like to have a child in the future, just that she doesn't want one instead of a life. The feature is also very careful not to shame her for having sex in the first place, even though certain unsympathetic characters certainly do just that. In doing so, it avoids perpetuating the misconception that pregnancy is perhaps some sort of punishment for premarital sex. In general, the film is fantastically feminist. It's also quietly confident in its construction, taking an almost minimalist approach to its material and putting a lot of focus on its superb central performance. It doesn't shy away from the more graphic elements of its narrative, featuring a couple of protracted attempted abortions that purposefully make you squirm. It isn't overly explicit and knows exactly when to stop so that it doesn't cheapen itself by trudging into gross-out territory. By going as far as it needs to (which is further than many of its contemporaries dare to go), it presents the truth of its situation. It doesn't pretend abortion is a painless procedure, which further hammers home the fact that it should be legal - and, dare I say, free - so that it can be performed in genuine hospitals by genuine doctors with genuine tools like any other genuine medical procedure. Making abortion illegal doesn't stop abortion from happening, it stops abortion from happening safely. The flick makes you care about its central character, so you're on the edge of your seat when she undergoes some of the dangerous procedures she's forced to undergo by the laws that govern her country. While you never want her to go through that kind of pain, you also never doubt the fact that she needs to. Furthermore, you never blame her for going through these life-threatening procedures. After all, what other choice does she have? Though the film itself is a little slow on occasion and it isn't conventionally enjoyable, it's an engaging and affecting experience throughout. It has something important to say and it knows exactly how to say it. It isn't necessarily an easy watch, but it's easily a necessary one.","9 February 2022","9/10",NA

" Happening (2021)","A Tough Watch","billcr12","""Life's greatest happiness is to be convinced we are loved"" - Victor HugoWinner of the Golden Lion Award at the 2021 Venice Film Festival, Audrey Diwan's (""Losing It"") harrowing abortion drama Happening takes place in rural France during the 1960s, a decade before abortion was legalized in France. Based on the memoir by Annie Erma (""Les Années Super-8""), the film is a gripping and, at times, uncomfortable reminder of the inherent physical and emotional dangers of illegal, ""back-alley"" abortions, procedures that pose a danger to the unborn child as well as to the health of the mother. Co-written by Marcia Romano (""Peaceful"") and brought to life by the naturalistic cinematography of Laurent Tangy (""Mascarade""), the film dramatizes a young woman's painful quest to terminate her unwanted pregnancy.In a perfectly realized performance by Anamaria Vartolomei (""How to Be a Good Wife""), Anne Duchesne is an ambitious literature student in her early twenties with aspirations to become a writer. She lives at a school dorm with her best friends Hélène (Luàna Bajrami, ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"") and Brigitte (Louise Orry-Diquéro, ""Occidental""), independent from her parents, Jacques and Gabrielle (Eric Verdin, ""Faithful"" and Sandrine Bonnaire, ""Into the World""). While immersed in her studies to gain admittance to a top university, Anne discovers that she is pregnant, a situation that will threaten her continued education.Diwan is unsparing in her depiction of the physical and emotional trauma a young girl had to go through to have an abortion, allowing us to see the graphic details that make Happening essential viewing for those confronting the Supreme Court decision to terminate Roe v Wade, the ruling that has protected abortion seekers and providers for the last fifty years in the United States. Until the moment of discovery, Anne is hard to distinguish from her immature roommates who spend their days studying and their nights looking for adventures at the local clubs.Here, women who interface too much with boys are called ""loose"" or ""sluts,"" and their sexual encounters consist of acting out of fantasies within their own dorm. When her roommates discover that Anne is pregnant, the temperature in their room plummets to zero, and Anne finds only grudging support from her ""best friend"" Brigitte, who tells her coldly that ""it's not our business."" While Diwan shows us the humiliation that Anne must endure, we learn very little of her history or her background and neither do we learn much about the young man who impregnated her.Aware of the possibility of jail for the patient and the medical practitioner, a doctor she has trusted (Fabrizio Rongione, ""The Unknown Girl"") in the past tells her that she has to keep the child, reminding her that she cannot even discuss the matter with him. In addition, Jean (Kacey Mottet Klein, ""Being 17""), a male friend, turns Anne's plea for help into a sexual proposition asking ""why not?"" since she no longer has any risk of becoming pregnant. Ultimately, Anne finds a surreptitious practitioner, Madame Rivière (Anna Mouglalis, ""The Salamander"") but that is only the beginning of her sorrows.Yet, for all of its disturbing images, in telling this ""horror"" story, Diwan avoids melodrama, offering a tense, engaging, and realistic picture of what the world was like for a young woman who is carrying an unwanted child and what it could be again unless our collective voices are heard. Like events shown in Ursula Meier's brilliant 2012 film ""Sister,"" life for an unwanted child may not be better than no life at all. Meier makes it evident that growing up in a world without love, even the most skillful and resilient child cannot fill the gaping hole it leaves.","7 September 2022","9/10",NA

" Happening (2021)","Strong, decisive and immediate","gortx","Like it's lead character, Anne (Anamaria Vartolomei), Director Audrey Diwan's HAPPENING is direct, strong and decisive. Anne is a very promising literature student who finds herself pregnant after a fling with a visiting student. The place is France in the early 60s when having a procedure to abort a baby is strictly illegal. Her closest friends and doctor want nothing to do with her plans - especially, her doctor, who's very counsel could land him in jail.Diwan's adaptation of Annie Ernaux's novel feels immediate, adopting an almost you are there approach (the script was co-written by Diwan and a trio of other writers). While it's certainly not a documentary construct, it's very much a drama, but it feels real. Laurent Tangy's hand-held camera is like an intimate partner to Diwan's vision. The active tense title is very much on point here (the French title also translates into ""The Event"").Vartolomei is quite excellent. She is often the only character on screen and her performance never seems studied, simply inhabited. The others in the cast are always believable even if they don't have time to really develop. Anna Mouglalis is particularly memorable as the blunt Mme. Riviere, and legendary European actress Sandrinne Bonnaire is on hand as Anne's mother.HAPPENING gets quite explicit at times, but never feels in the least exploitative. The screenplay is also admirable in that it never preaches. Diwan follows her character on her own terms all the way through. It's a difficult movie, but a very worthy one.","2 February 2023","8/10",NA

One of them is Annie (or Anne). Then later, Annie goes to see a doctor as her period is late. The doctor informs her that she is pregnant, to Annie's shock. She asks the doctor ""to do something"" but he flat-out refuses, as abortion is illegal and carries a penalty in jail... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from French-Lebanese writer-director Audrey Diwan (""Losing It""). Here she brings the real life tale of what happens to a young woman in her early 20s who gets pregnant in a time and space where abortion is entirely illegal without any exceptions (France in the early 60s). Watch how Annie gets no support, zero, from anyone around her including doctors, family and friends, and even her lover. Watch how increasingly desperate Annie becomes as the weeks pass. Please note that some scenes are very difficult to watch. The US premiere of this film came at the 2022 Sundance film festival, just over a year ago, and mere months before the US Supreme Court overruled Re v.

Anyone tempted to view the backwards beliefs and legislations that plague not only its central character but, indirectly or otherwise, every other female character in the entire affair as a product of their time is either wilfully ignorant or set to have a very rude awakening when they turn on the news. Film has always been a great tool for empathy, offering a glimpse into the life of someone other than yourself. In many cases, it allows people to connect with the lived experiences of groups of people they're unlikely to ever even meet, let alone directly identify with. Watching someone, fictional or otherwise, undergo a struggle completely alien to yourself is something that, if approached with the right mindset, can widen your worldview and allow you to more easily understand those with vastly different lived experiences to that of your own. This movie does just that. It places you in the shoes of a quietly determined young student who becomes pregnant and does everything she can to obtain an abortion. For whatever reason, a woman's right to choose what happens with her own body is still a touchy subject. Here, though, it's rendered with such aplomb that it's almost hard to imagine even the most devout republican having an issue with the central character's decision.

Actually, that's probably giving devout republicans too much credit. Regardless, the point still stands that the picture does an excellent job of putting you in the inconvenienced and isolated shoes of its protagonist. It does an excellent job at conveying the deep-rooted sense of betrayal that comes with everyone around you denying your right to choose what happens to you. Doctors become enemies, families become distant, friends become nothing more than faces in the crowd, and the future suddenly doesn't seem quite as bright as it used to. Despite this growing loneliness and desperation, the lead never loses her focus. She never questions her decision or, more importantly, that it's a decision she and she alone can make. Crucially, her pregnancy isn't the result of incest or a rape and there's no indication that her baby will be unhealthy or that their birth would present a danger to her own life. Instead, her pregnancy is the only thing it should need to be in order for an abortion to be administered: unwanted. By doing this, it argues for universal bodily autonomy and presents the case that abortion is a right regardless of circumstance. The protagonist even says she'd like to have a child in the future, just that she doesn't want one instead of a life. The feature is also very careful not to shame her for having sex in the first place, even though certain unsympathetic characters certainly do just that. In doing so, it avoids perpetuating the misconception that pregnancy is perhaps some sort of punishment for premarital sex. In general, the film is fantastically feminist. It's also quietly confident in its construction, taking an almost minimalist approach to its material and putting a lot of focus on its superb central performance. It doesn't shy away from the more graphic elements of its narrative, featuring a couple of protracted attempted abortions that purposefully make you squirm. It isn't overly explicit and knows exactly when to stop so that it doesn't cheapen itself by trudging into gross-out territory. By going as far as it needs to (which is further than many of its contemporaries dare to go), it presents the truth of its situation. It doesn't pretend abortion is a painless procedure, which further hammers home the fact that it should be legal - and, dare I say, free - so that it can be performed in genuine hospitals by genuine doctors with genuine tools like any other genuine medical procedure. Making abortion illegal doesn't stop abortion from happening, it stops abortion from happening safely. The flick makes you care about its central character, so you're on the edge of your seat when she undergoes some of the dangerous procedures she's forced to undergo by the laws that govern her country. While you never want her to go through that kind of pain, you also never doubt the fact that she needs to. Furthermore, you never blame her for going through these life-threatening procedures. After all, what other choice does she have? Though the film itself is a little slow on occasion and it isn't conventionally enjoyable, it's an engaging and affecting experience throughout. It has something important to say and it knows exactly how to say it. It isn't necessarily an easy watch, but it's easily a necessary one.","9 February 2022","9/10",NA

" Happening (2021)","A Tough Watch","billcr12","""Life's greatest happiness is to be convinced we are loved"" - Victor HugoWinner of the Golden Lion Award at the 2021 Venice Film Festival, Audrey Diwan's (""Losing It"") harrowing abortion drama Happening takes place in rural France during the 1960s, a decade before abortion was legalized in France. Based on the memoir by Annie Erma (""Les Années Super-8""), the film is a gripping and, at times, uncomfortable reminder of the inherent physical and emotional dangers of illegal, ""back-alley"" abortions, procedures that pose a danger to the unborn child as well as to the health of the mother. Co-written by Marcia Romano (""Peaceful"") and brought to life by the naturalistic cinematography of Laurent Tangy (""Mascarade""), the film dramatizes a young woman's painful quest to terminate her unwanted pregnancy.In a perfectly realized performance by Anamaria Vartolomei (""How to Be a Good Wife""), Anne Duchesne is an ambitious literature student in her early twenties with aspirations to become a writer. She lives at a school dorm with her best friends Hélène (Luàna Bajrami, ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"") and Brigitte (Louise Orry-Diquéro, ""Occidental""), independent from her parents, Jacques and Gabrielle (Eric Verdin, ""Faithful"" and Sandrine Bonnaire, ""Into the World""). While immersed in her studies to gain admittance to a top university, Anne discovers that she is pregnant, a situation that will threaten her continued education.Diwan is unsparing in her depiction of the physical and emotional trauma a young girl had to go through to have an abortion, allowing us to see the graphic details that make Happening essential viewing for those confronting the Supreme Court decision to terminate Roe v Wade, the ruling that has protected abortion seekers and providers for the last fifty years in the United States. Until the moment of discovery, Anne is hard to distinguish from her immature roommates who spend their days studying and their nights looking for adventures at the local clubs.Here, women who interface too much with boys are called ""loose"" or ""sluts,"" and their sexual encounters consist of acting out of fantasies within their own dorm. When her roommates discover that Anne is pregnant, the temperature in their room plummets to zero, and Anne finds only grudging support from her ""best friend"" Brigitte, who tells her coldly that ""it's not our business."" While Diwan shows us the humiliation that Anne must endure, we learn very little of her history or her background and neither do we learn much about the young man who impregnated her.Aware of the possibility of jail for the patient and the medical practitioner, a doctor she has trusted (Fabrizio Rongione, ""The Unknown Girl"") in the past tells her that she has to keep the child, reminding her that she cannot even discuss the matter with him. In addition, Jean (Kacey Mottet Klein, ""Being 17""), a male friend, turns Anne's plea for help into a sexual proposition asking ""why not?"" since she no longer has any risk of becoming pregnant. Ultimately, Anne finds a surreptitious practitioner, Madame Rivière (Anna Mouglalis, ""The Salamander"") but that is only the beginning of her sorrows.Yet, for all of its disturbing images, in telling this ""horror"" story, Diwan avoids melodrama, offering a tense, engaging, and realistic picture of what the world was like for a young woman who is carrying an unwanted child and what it could be again unless our collective voices are heard. Like events shown in Ursula Meier's brilliant 2012 film ""Sister,"" life for an unwanted child may not be better than no life at all. Meier makes it evident that growing up in a world without love, even the most skillful and resilient child cannot fill the gaping hole it leaves.","7 September 2022","9/10",NA

" Happening (2021)","Strong, decisive and immediate","gortx","Like it's lead character, Anne (Anamaria Vartolomei), Director Audrey Diwan's HAPPENING is direct, strong and decisive. Anne is a very promising literature student who finds herself pregnant after a fling with a visiting student. The place is France in the early 60s when having a procedure to abort a baby is strictly illegal. Her closest friends and doctor want nothing to do with her plans - especially, her doctor, who's very counsel could land him in jail.Diwan's adaptation of Annie Ernaux's novel feels immediate, adopting an almost you are there approach (the script was co-written by Diwan and a trio of other writers). While it's certainly not a documentary construct, it's very much a drama, but it feels real. Laurent Tangy's hand-held camera is like an intimate partner to Diwan's vision. The active tense title is very much on point here (the French title also translates into ""The Event"").Vartolomei is quite excellent. She is often the only character on screen and her performance never seems studied, simply inhabited. The others in the cast are always believable even if they don't have time to really develop. Anna Mouglalis is particularly memorable as the blunt Mme. Riviere, and legendary European actress Sandrinne Bonnaire is on hand as Anne's mother.HAPPENING gets quite explicit at times, but never feels in the least exploitative. The screenplay is also admirable in that it never preaches. Diwan follows her character on her own terms all the way through.

One of them is Annie (or Anne). Then later, Annie goes to see a doctor as her period is late. The doctor informs her that she is pregnant, to Annie's shock. She asks the doctor ""to do something"" but he flat-out refuses, as abortion is illegal and carries a penalty in jail... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from French-Lebanese writer-director Audrey Diwan (""Losing It""). Here she brings the real life tale of what happens to a young woman in her early 20s who gets pregnant in a time and space where abortion is entirely illegal without any exceptions (France in the early 60s). Watch how Annie gets no support, zero, from anyone around her including doctors, family and friends, and even her lover. Watch how increasingly desperate Annie becomes as the weeks pass. Please note that some scenes are very difficult to watch. The US premiere of this film came at the 2022 Sundance film festival, just over a year ago, and mere months before the US Supreme Court overruled Re v.

This movie does just that. It places you in the shoes of a quietly determined young student who becomes pregnant and does everything she can to obtain an abortion. For whatever reason, a woman's right to choose what happens with her own body is still a touchy subject. Here, though, it's rendered with such aplomb that it's almost hard to imagine even the most devout republican having an issue with the central character's decision. Actually, that's probably giving devout republicans too much credit. Regardless, the point still stands that the picture does an excellent job of putting you in the inconvenienced and isolated shoes of its protagonist. It does an excellent job at conveying the deep-rooted sense of betrayal that comes with everyone around you denying your right to choose what happens to you. Doctors become enemies, families become distant, friends become nothing more than faces in the crowd, and the future suddenly doesn't seem quite as bright as it used to. Despite this growing loneliness and desperation, the lead never loses her focus. She never questions her decision or, more importantly, that it's a decision she and she alone can make. Crucially, her pregnancy isn't the result of incest or a rape and there's no indication that her baby will be unhealthy or that their birth would present a danger to her own life. Instead, her pregnancy is the only thing it should need to be in order for an abortion to be administered: unwanted. By doing this, it argues for universal bodily autonomy and presents the case that abortion is a right regardless of circumstance. The protagonist even says she'd like to have a child in the future, just that she doesn't want one instead of a life. The feature is also very careful not to shame her for having sex in the first place, even though certain unsympathetic characters certainly do just that. In doing so, it avoids perpetuating the misconception that pregnancy is perhaps some sort of punishment for premarital sex. In general, the film is fantastically feminist. It's also quietly confident in its construction, taking an almost minimalist approach to its material and putting a lot of focus on its superb central performance. It doesn't shy away from the more graphic elements of its narrative, featuring a couple of protracted attempted abortions that purposefully make you squirm. It isn't overly explicit and knows exactly when to stop so that it doesn't cheapen itself by trudging into gross-out territory. By going as far as it needs to (which is further than many of its contemporaries dare to go), it presents the truth of its situation. It doesn't pretend abortion is a painless procedure, which further hammers home the fact that it should be legal - and, dare I say, free - so that it can be performed in genuine hospitals by genuine doctors with genuine tools like any other genuine medical procedure. Making abortion illegal doesn't stop abortion from happening, it stops abortion from happening safely. The flick makes you care about its central character, so you're on the edge of your seat when she undergoes some of the dangerous procedures she's forced to undergo by the laws that govern her country. While you never want her to go through that kind of pain, you also never doubt the fact that she needs to. Furthermore, you never blame her for going through these life-threatening procedures. After all, what other choice does she have? Though the film itself is a little slow on occasion and it isn't conventionally enjoyable, it's an engaging and affecting experience throughout. It has something important to say and it knows exactly how to say it. It isn't necessarily an easy watch, but it's easily a necessary one.","9 February 2022","9/10",NA

Cinematically, she succeeds.The genre of great abortion movies is pretty small, one thinks of the Romanian 4 months 3 weeks and 2 days, but this one is near the top.

" Happening (2021)","A Tough Watch","billcr12","""Life's greatest happiness is to be convinced we are loved"" - Victor HugoWinner of the Golden Lion Award at the 2021 Venice Film Festival, Audrey Diwan's (""Losing It"") harrowing abortion drama Happening takes place in rural France during the 1960s, a decade before abortion was legalized in France. Based on the memoir by Annie Erma (""Les Années Super-8""), the film is a gripping and, at times, uncomfortable reminder of the inherent physical and emotional dangers of illegal, ""back-alley"" abortions, procedures that pose a danger to the unborn child as well as to the health of the mother. Co-written by Marcia Romano (""Peaceful"") and brought to life by the naturalistic cinematography of Laurent Tangy (""Mascarade""), the film dramatizes a young woman's painful quest to terminate her unwanted pregnancy.In a perfectly realized performance by Anamaria Vartolomei (""How to Be a Good Wife""), Anne Duchesne is an ambitious literature student in her early twenties with aspirations to become a writer. She lives at a school dorm with her best friends Hélène (Luàna Bajrami, ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"") and Brigitte (Louise Orry-Diquéro, ""Occidental""), independent from her parents, Jacques and Gabrielle (Eric Verdin, ""Faithful"" and Sandrine Bonnaire, ""Into the World""). While immersed in her studies to gain admittance to a top university, Anne discovers that she is pregnant, a situation that will threaten her continued education.Diwan is unsparing in her depiction of the physical and emotional trauma a young girl had to go through to have an abortion, allowing us to see the graphic details that make Happening essential viewing for those confronting the Supreme Court decision to terminate Roe v Wade, the ruling that has protected abortion seekers and providers for the last fifty years in the United States. Until the moment of discovery, Anne is hard to distinguish from her immature roommates who spend their days studying and their nights looking for adventures at the local clubs.Here, women who interface too much with boys are called ""loose"" or ""sluts,"" and their sexual encounters consist of acting out of fantasies within their own dorm. When her roommates discover that Anne is pregnant, the temperature in their room plummets to zero, and Anne finds only grudging support from her ""best friend"" Brigitte, who tells her coldly that ""it's not our business."" While Diwan shows us the humiliation that Anne must endure, we learn very little of her history or her background and neither do we learn much about the young man who impregnated her.Aware of the possibility of jail for the patient and the medical practitioner, a doctor she has trusted (Fabrizio Rongione, ""The Unknown Girl"") in the past tells her that she has to keep the child, reminding her that she cannot even discuss the matter with him. In addition, Jean (Kacey Mottet Klein, ""Being 17""), a male friend, turns Anne's plea for help into a sexual proposition asking ""why not?"" since she no longer has any risk of becoming pregnant. Ultimately, Anne finds a surreptitious practitioner, Madame Rivière (Anna Mouglalis, ""The Salamander"") but that is only the beginning of her sorrows.Yet, for all of its disturbing images, in telling this ""horror"" story, Diwan avoids melodrama, offering a tense, engaging, and realistic picture of what the world was like for a young woman who is carrying an unwanted child and what it could be again unless our collective voices are heard. Like events shown in Ursula Meier's brilliant 2012 film ""Sister,"" life for an unwanted child may not be better than no life at all. Meier makes it evident that growing up in a world without love, even the most skillful and resilient child cannot fill the gaping hole it leaves.","7 September 2022","9/10",NA
" Happening (2021)","Tense, engaging, and realistic","howard.schumann","A controversial topic. Dealt with the perspective of a woman. Good acting. Personally I would have only made it more graphic with respect to bloody towels and blood. But that would change its rating. So apart from that good buildup, but lacks in middle. Maybe a bigger meltdown was to be shown. The embrace with her mother just was too much to handle for me. Music tones dropping at places to corelate with the plot, was interesting and rightly done, so that was nice. I would suggest it only if you try to watch it with an open mind. On controversial topics, whether you agree or not, is a different question. Atleast you should see the point. You dont have to agree. You can give your points.

"The Worst Person in the World (2021)","not the usual","ferguson-6","Greetings again from the darkness. It's often fun when an innovative filmmaker turns a stodgy genre upside down and offers us a new take. And who better to flip over the frequently stale mode of romantic-comedies than Norwegian auteur Joachim Trier? Co-written with his frequent collaborator Eskil Vogt, the film could also be described as a dramady or a thirty-ish coming-of-age tale. Regardless of the label, it's entertaining and thought-provoking, as well as being a bit dark in parts (some of these also being quite funny). This is being called the final film in Trier's ""Oslo Trilogy"", three loosely connected films including REPRISE (2006) and OSLO, AUGUST 31 (2011).Each of the films represents quite a shift in tone, and this latest revolves around Julie, played exceptionally well by Renate Reinsve. Trier structures the film as 12 chapters plus a prologue and epilogue. The prologue is brilliant and allows us to quickly grasp what we need to know about Julie. She changes her life goals multiple times - from doctor to psychologist to photographer, and later while working in a bookstore, she decides to be a writer. Thankfully we are spared the details in her essay on oral sex in the #MeToo era. Julie is impulsive to a fault. She has confidence but can't commit to a direction - she's confident in her uncertainty.As she approaches 30, Julie is struggling to find her way. She's not so much lost as struggling to deal with her jumbled thoughts. Can you lose your identity if you haven't yet formed one? That seems to be the crux of Julie's inner-struggles, even as she finds a seemingly good fit for a partner. Aksel (a terrific Anders Danielsen Lie) is a successful graphic artist, and he seems to understand Julie. Their relationship builds over time, even as their individual visions and goals diverge. The best life partner still comes with challenges when you still aren't sure who you are as a person.Julie feels herself slipping away, and that's when her impulsive nature reappears. During a special event for Aksel, she walks out and spontaneously crashes a local wedding reception. This leads to a meet cute and flirty time with Eivind (Herbert Nordrum). Both he and she are in steady relationships, but only Bill Clinton could determine if the time Julie and Eivind spend together is cheating or not. Ms. Reinsve perfectly captures the spirit of Julie. Although she's often a bit flustered, when she does smile, she radiates like a young Shelley Fabares.Much has been made of Ms. Reinsve's performance and she certainly deserves the accolades. However, we shouldn't overlook the outstanding work of Anders Danielsen Lie in a difficult role. Filmmaker Joachim Trier's previous work also includes THELMA (2017) and LOUDER THAN BOMBS (2015), and his creativity is most welcome. Two sequences stand out in his latest. In one, the world shifts into 'freeze frame' mode as Julie runs through the streets of Oslo to find her new love, and in the second, we follow her in the midst of a drug hallucination after experimenting with mushrooms. In the story, Trier focuses on the dynamics between partners and how the stages of life can complicate things. It's charming and funny, but also quite serious, as he certainly doesn't buy into the ideal that movies must have happy endings. In regard to the title, rather than describe Julie, it's more likely meant to explain how many people think of themselves as they make decisions and mistakes - it's really a show of humanity.

I really felt it, y'know? Not in a way that's going to make me reshape my life or change what I'm doing day to day necessarily, but there was something to it that makes me sure it's going to stick in my brain for weeks, maybe months or even years to come.I can't go much further than that. It's a wonderful, sometimes funny, sometimes bittersweet, sometimes soul-crushing film, and all the emotions are explored and interweaved perfectly.There are so many great scenes... the scene where time freezes, the ""what is cheating"" scene, the scene in and around the hospital, the scene with the magic mushrooms... it's almost like every single chapter in the film is a highlight, and it all fits together almost perfectly.It's a special film- the more I think about it, the better it gets, and the more it resonates. Also features some of the best acting I've seen in a while from its two leads, Renate Reinsve and Anders Danielsen Lie. They're so compelling it's almost alarming how invested you get in their characters, maybe because they begin to feel like real people, at a point. Especially in the last half-hour or so- I was blown away by how real they felt, and how easily I believed that these two characters had known each other for years.Might be a 5/5 on a rewatch, in all honesty. Life being tough and all at the moment, I was distracted by some of my own problems while watching these fictional characters deal with theirs. But the moments of crossover were extremely cathartic, and as a film, it flows so well, and didn't feel two hours long, despite having pacing that wasn't afraid to slow down from time to time.Well, how about that.I actually wrote quite a lot.Good films will do that to you.","5 February 2022","9/10",NA
"The Worst Person in the World (2021)","An Achingly Accurate Portrait Of Millennial Angst","CinemaClown","An achingly human & frighteningly accurate portrait of an entire generation's existential crisis, The Worst Person in the World observes millennial angst through a young woman's quest for love & meaning as she enters into her 30s without any idea about her identity & purpose in life. Crafted with flair & told with utmost honesty, this contemporary rom-com is one of the better films of the year.Co-written & directed by Joachim Trier, the story is narrated in chapters and covers her four years journey of love & enlightenment in which we see her throw herself into different career paths & new relationships yet never going all the way. While most episodes are interesting & aptly address the film's themes, few of them are way too brief and should've been either left out or integrated with others.The first half is lighthearted & brimming with a restless, radiant spirit while the later chapters deal with heavier themes and are treated with required seriousness. Renate Reinsve anchors the film with a performance that hits the right emotional notes and is thoroughly convincing. Anders Danielsen Lie & Herbert Nordrum also chip in with strong support and their chemistry with Reinsve is seamless & spot-on.Overall, The Worst Person in the World is a downright sincere & thoroughly engrossing effort that renders the humanity of its characters with authenticity & compassion. Heartbreaking yet not without hope, this Norwegian dramedy understands the dreaded existential cul-de-sac that comes from not knowing who you are or where you fit in as well as the the crushing feeling of playing a supporting role in your own life story.","16 May 2022","9/10",NA
"The Worst Person in the World (2021)","You were the love of my life.","Pjtaylor-96-138044","'The Worst Person in the World (2021)' is a deeply moving experience. It resonates with me in a way that very few films do. I feel it. It isn't just entertainment, it's something more. Exactly what that is, I can't quite say. Through a seemingly simple story of one woman's life, the picture works its way into your mind, your heart, your soul itself and provokes powerful emotions that you didn't even know movies could provoke; not just sadness or joy or excitement or longing (all of which it provokes in droves), but the kind of emotions that can't be put into words, the kind that weigh on your consciousness and shape your relationship with yourself and the world around you. It's difficult to describe, really, and I'm sure I'm probably slipping into hyperbole. I've lost any sense of objectivity (what little I usually have, at any rate) when it comes to discussing this picture, because its ultimate impact is one that I just can't shake and I'm not sure I ever want to. It's a profoundly affecting affair, one that overcomes any of its initial slowness or slice-of-life limitations, thanks primarily to its uncompromisingly complex nature. It's one of the most honest pieces of fiction I've ever seen, crafting characters who seem like they could walk off the screen and representing reality - or, at least, our lived experience of it - in a way that most kitchen-sink dramas could only dream of doing. It presents a plethora of powerful and often poignant ideas that keenly represent the human condition, all while remembering that its protagonist is the one driving the action and that it owes her a fully-formed narrative that entertains as much as it stirs. Its infrequent formalistic touches are absolutely delightful, but it's the rock-solid 'regular' stuff that matters the most. These moments are told not with style, but with substance; the actors often tell entire libraries worth of stories with their eyes alone. Indeed, this is some of the best acting I've seen in a long time, capable of conveying thought and emotion without so much as a single word. It's often all in the eyes; you could get lost in the pupils of its two leads. The chapter-based structure lends vitality to a plot that may otherwise have felt a little aimless, and the writing is simply divine. The feature just nails everything it sets out to achieve. The more I think about it, the more I like it. It's the sort of thing that proves ratings are insignificant. How can you assign stars to something like this? I can't put my feelings into words, let alone stars. I can't quantify it by the same metrics I use for other films. Even if it isn't as entertaining as the ones I enjoy the most, it's almost certainly much more powerful; very few of them make me feel the way this one does. Maybe another viewing is necessary to determine the picture's true score. Then again, maybe this right here - what I'm feeling right now - is more than enough. It isn't the sort of thing I experience very often; as such, it's a bit hard to process. What else can I say? This is honestly the kind of film that I could see changing your life in one way or another, however small and seemingly insignificant. As I mentioned earlier, it's a deeply moving experience.","29 November 2021","8/10",NA
"The Worst Person in the World (2021)","the story of an imperfect woman","dromasca","The heroine ofJoachim Trier's latest film 'The Worst Person in the World' (2021) is about 30 years old, but she still hasn't managed to find a profession that would give full meaning to her life, or the man she would like to be with and spend the rest of her life, or what could make her happy. It is, if you wish, the film of her searches and the failure of these searches in a hurried and individualistic world. This contemporary Norwegian counter-heroine is one of the most complex and interesting female characters I have seen on screen in recent years. Renate Reinsve's formidable performance brought her a well-deserved award for female performance at the Cannes Film Festival. This is one of the important reasons, but not the only one for which this film is worth seeing.Julie (Renate Reinsve) is an intelligent and intellectually gifted young woman. She starts studying medicine and then gives up, starts studying psychology and abandons this as well, decides to become a photographer and works in parallel and as a bookseller at a bookstore. Her parents are divorced, she is closer to her mother (who is worried about her daughter's un-decisions) while her distant and indifferent father is a negative model that probably makes her wary of relationships with men. And yet she falls in love, not with one man but with two: with a comics book writer and cartoonist about 14 years her senior who wants a child and with a seller at a pastry shop who wants to have fun and maybe to get rid of his previous girlfriend who is more interested by ecology and vegetarianism. Time passes, life advances, but it is not clear in which direction.I guess that one of 'Joachim Trier's sources of inspiration are Woody Allen's older and newer films. The organization of the story in 12 chapters plus a prologue and an epilogue, the well-matched use in this case of off-screen voice, the relationship between lovers separated by age gap, the presence of parents in the lives of mature people, all these they reminded Allen. Even the almost exclusively urban setting seems inspired by his films, with a local touch, of course. If you haven't visited Oslo (like me) by the time you finish watching this movie you will feel the desire to visit this city, which looks colorful, sophisticated, and ... warm (most of the story seems to take place in the summer). The location in time is clear, thanks to the pandemic masks that the characters wear in the epilogue. Just count a few years back. There are at least two chapters in the film with original cinematography that fits well into the logic of the story - the imaginary or real encounter between lovers looking for and finding each other with the rest of the world frozen around and the sequence of the 'experimentation' with hallucinogenic mushrooms. 'The Worst Person in the World' is the story of an imperfect woman with an imperfect life, as are the lives of most of us, a woman who is certainly not the worst person in the world, and the film about her is made interestingly and well acted.

I wasn't right for a week after seeing that film. 'The Worst Person in the World' has a similar quality. Ultimately it is just showing the harsh realities of life. But man do they hit hard. This film is incredible.This film wouldn't be what it is without Renate Reinsve. I haven't seen all of the Best Actress nominees for the Oscars this year yet, however I'd be shocked if all five could justify their place over her. She is mesmerising to watch. She puts everything she has out there. It is as fearless and captivating as performances come. I'm so glad she won Best Actress at Cannes.The entire cast is great but I have to mention Anders Danielsen Lie specifically as well. He plays a crucial role in this film being what it is. It's a truly excellently written role to be fair, but he still plays his part in bringing it to life. He's the character that a lot of men who watch this film are going to relate to.The dialogue in this film is on another level. It is so deep and thoughtful. The amount of lines that resonated with me were huge. The film never feels like it is trying too hard to impress anything upon you either. It simply puts stuff out there, and it just so happens that the stuff is so good it hits you like a freight train.If someone asked me what this film was about I think I'd find that a very hard question to answer. I guess the best answer would just be ""life"". Maybe it won't resonate with everyone else like it did with me (although the film seems to be getting a lot of positive feedback which I'm stoked about) but I don't think many could watch this masterpiece and not get something out of it. 10/10.","8 March 2022","10/10",NA

"The Worst Person in the World (2021)","An Achingly Accurate Portrait Of Millennial Angst","CinemaClown","An achingly human & frighteningly accurate portrait of an entire generation's existential crisis, The Worst Person in the World observes millennial angst through a young woman's quest for love & meaning as she enters into her 30s without any idea about her identity & purpose in life. Crafted with flair & told with utmost honesty, this contemporary rom-com is one of the better films of the year.Co-written & directed by Joachim Trier, the story is narrated in chapters and covers her four years journey of love & enlightenment in which we see her throw herself into different career paths & new relationships yet never going all the way. While most episodes are interesting & aptly address the film's themes, few of them are way too brief and should've been either left out or integrated with others.The first half is lighthearted & brimming with a restless, radiant spirit while the later chapters deal with heavier themes and are treated with required seriousness. Renate Reinsve anchors the film with a performance that hits the right emotional notes and is thoroughly convincing. Anders Danielsen Lie & Herbert Nordrum also chip in with strong support and their chemistry with Reinsve is seamless & spot-on.Overall, The Worst Person in the World is a downright sincere & thoroughly engrossing effort that renders the humanity of its characters with authenticity & compassion. Heartbreaking yet not without hope, this Norwegian dramedy understands the dreaded existential cul-de-sac that comes from not knowing who you are or where you fit in as well as the the crushing feeling of playing a supporting role in your own life story.","16 May 2022","9/10",NA
"The Worst Person in the World (2021)","You were the love of my life.","Pjtaylor-96-138044","'The Worst Person in the World (2021)' is a deeply moving experience. It resonates with me in a way that very few films do. I feel it. It isn't just entertainment, it's something more. Exactly what that is, I can't quite say. Through a seemingly simple story of one woman's life, the picture works its way into your mind, your heart, your soul itself and provokes powerful emotions that you didn't even know movies could provoke; not just sadness or joy or excitement or longing (all of which it provokes in droves), but the kind of emotions that can't be put into words, the kind that weigh on your consciousness and shape your relationship with yourself and the world around you. It's difficult to describe, really, and I'm sure I'm probably slipping into hyperbole. I've lost any sense of objectivity (what little I usually have, at any rate) when it comes to discussing this picture, because its ultimate impact is one that I just can't shake and I'm not sure I ever want to. It's a profoundly affecting affair, one that overcomes any of its initial slowness or slice-of-life limitations, thanks primarily to its uncompromisingly complex nature. It's one of the most honest pieces of fiction I've ever seen, crafting characters who seem like they could walk off the screen and representing reality - or, at least, our lived experience of it - in a way that most kitchen-sink dramas could only dream of doing. It presents a plethora of powerful and often poignant ideas that keenly represent the human condition, all while remembering that its protagonist is the one driving the action and that it owes her a fully-formed narrative that entertains as much as it stirs. Its infrequent formalistic touches are absolutely delightful, but it's the rock-solid 'regular' stuff that matters the most. These moments are told not with style, but with substance; the actors often tell entire libraries worth of stories with their eyes alone. Indeed, this is some of the best acting I've seen in a long time, capable of conveying thought and emotion without so much as a single word. It's often all in the eyes; you could get lost in the pupils of its two leads. The chapter-based structure lends vitality to a plot that may otherwise have felt a little aimless, and the writing is simply divine. The feature just nails everything it sets out to achieve. The more I think about it, the more I like it. It's the sort of thing that proves ratings are insignificant. How can you assign stars to something like this? I can't put my feelings into words, let alone stars. I can't quantify it by the same metrics I use for other films. Even if it isn't as entertaining as the ones I enjoy the most, it's almost certainly much more powerful; very few of them make me feel the way this one does. Maybe another viewing is necessary to determine the picture's true score. Then again, maybe this right here - what I'm feeling right now - is more than enough. It isn't the sort of thing I experience very often; as such, it's a bit hard to process. What else can I say? This is honestly the kind of film that I could see changing your life in one way or another, however small and seemingly insignificant. As I mentioned earlier, it's a deeply moving experience.","29 November 2021","8/10",NA
"The Worst Person in the World (2021)","the story of an imperfect woman","dromasca","The heroine ofJoachim Trier's latest film 'The Worst Person in the World' (2021) is about 30 years old, but she still hasn't managed to find a profession that would give full meaning to her life, or the man she would like to be with and spend the rest of her life, or what could make her happy. It is, if you wish, the film of her searches and the failure of these searches in a hurried and individualistic world. This contemporary Norwegian counter-heroine is one of the most complex and interesting female characters I have seen on screen in recent years. Renate Reinsve's formidable performance brought her a well-deserved award for female performance at the Cannes Film Festival. This is one of the important reasons, but not the only one for which this film is worth seeing.Julie (Renate Reinsve) is an intelligent and intellectually gifted young woman. She starts studying medicine and then gives up, starts studying psychology and abandons this as well, decides to become a photographer and works in parallel and as a bookseller at a bookstore. Her parents are divorced, she is closer to her mother (who is worried about her daughter's un-decisions) while her distant and indifferent father is a negative model that probably makes her wary of relationships with men. And yet she falls in love, not with one man but with two: with a comics book writer and cartoonist about 14 years her senior who wants a child and with a seller at a pastry shop who wants to have fun and maybe to get rid of his previous girlfriend who is more interested by ecology and vegetarianism. Time passes, life advances, but it is not clear in which direction.I guess that one of 'Joachim Trier's sources of inspiration are Woody Allen's older and newer films. The organization of the story in 12 chapters plus a prologue and an epilogue, the well-matched use in this case of off-screen voice, the relationship between lovers separated by age gap, the presence of parents in the lives of mature people, all these they reminded Allen. Even the almost exclusively urban setting seems inspired by his films, with a local touch, of course. If you haven't visited Oslo (like me) by the time you finish watching this movie you will feel the desire to visit this city, which looks colorful, sophisticated, and ... warm (most of the story seems to take place in the summer). The location in time is clear, thanks to the pandemic masks that the characters wear in the epilogue. Just count a few years back. There are at least two chapters in the film with original cinematography that fits well into the logic of the story - the imaginary or real encounter between lovers looking for and finding each other with the rest of the world frozen around and the sequence of the 'experimentation' with hallucinogenic mushrooms. 'The Worst Person in the World' is the story of an imperfect woman with an imperfect life, as are the lives of most of us, a woman who is certainly not the worst person in the world, and the film about her is made interestingly and well acted. Recommended viewing.","4 April 2022","6/10",NA
"The Worst Person in the World (2021)","Watchable Millennial Drama","martimusross","Sometimes a film cuts deep into your soul - in the best way possible. It happened to me in 2012 with 'Amour'. I wasn't right for a week after seeing that film. 'The Worst Person in the World' has a similar quality. Ultimately it is just showing the harsh realities of life. But man do they hit hard. This film is incredible.This film wouldn't be what it is without Renate Reinsve. I haven't seen all of the Best Actress nominees for the Oscars this year yet, however I'd be shocked if all five could justify their place over her. She is mesmerising to watch. She puts everything she has out there. It is as fearless and captivating as performances come. I'm so glad she won Best Actress at Cannes.The entire cast is great but I have to mention Anders Danielsen Lie specifically as well. He plays a crucial role in this film being what it is. It's a truly excellently written role to be fair, but he still plays his part in bringing it to life. He's the character that a lot of men who watch this film are going to relate to.The dialogue in this film is on another level. It is so deep and thoughtful. The amount of lines that resonated with me were huge. The film never feels like it is trying too hard to impress anything upon you either. It simply puts stuff out there, and it just so happens that the stuff is so good it hits you like a freight train.If someone asked me what this film was about I think I'd find that a very hard question to answer.

"The Worst Person in the World (2021)","not the usual","ferguson-6","Greetings again from the darkness. It's often fun when an innovative filmmaker turns a stodgy genre upside down and offers us a new take. And who better to flip over the frequently stale mode of romantic-comedies than Norwegian auteur Joachim Trier? Co-written with his frequent collaborator Eskil Vogt, the film could also be described as a dramady or a thirty-ish coming-of-age tale. Regardless of the label, it's entertaining and thought-provoking, as well as being a bit dark in parts (some of these also being quite funny). This is being called the final film in Trier's ""Oslo Trilogy"", three loosely connected films including REPRISE (2006) and OSLO, AUGUST 31 (2011).Each of the films represents quite a shift in tone, and this latest revolves around Julie, played exceptionally well by Renate Reinsve. Trier structures the film as 12 chapters plus a prologue and epilogue. The prologue is brilliant and allows us to quickly grasp what we need to know about Julie. She changes her life goals multiple times - from doctor to psychologist to photographer, and later while working in a bookstore, she decides to be a writer. Thankfully we are spared the details in her essay on oral sex in the #MeToo era. Julie is impulsive to a fault. She has confidence but can't commit to a direction - she's confident in her uncertainty.As she approaches 30, Julie is struggling to find her way. She's not so much lost as struggling to deal with her jumbled thoughts. Can you lose your identity if you haven't yet formed one? That seems to be the crux of Julie's inner-struggles, even as she finds a seemingly good fit for a partner. Aksel (a terrific Anders Danielsen Lie) is a successful graphic artist, and he seems to understand Julie. Their relationship builds over time, even as their individual visions and goals diverge. The best life partner still comes with challenges when you still aren't sure who you are as a person.Julie feels herself slipping away, and that's when her impulsive nature reappears. During a special event for Aksel, she walks out and spontaneously crashes a local wedding reception. This leads to a meet cute and flirty time with Eivind (Herbert Nordrum). Both he and she are in steady relationships, but only Bill Clinton could determine if the time Julie and Eivind spend together is cheating or not. Ms. Reinsve perfectly captures the spirit of Julie. Although she's often a bit flustered, when she does smile, she radiates like a young Shelley Fabares.Much has been made of Ms. Reinsve's performance and she certainly deserves the accolades. However, we shouldn't overlook the outstanding work of Anders Danielsen Lie in a difficult role. Filmmaker Joachim Trier's previous work also includes THELMA (2017) and LOUDER THAN BOMBS (2015), and his creativity is most welcome. Two sequences stand out in his latest. In one, the world shifts into 'freeze frame' mode as Julie runs through the streets of Oslo to find her new love, and in the second, we follow her in the midst of a drug hallucination after experimenting with mushrooms. In the story, Trier focuses on the dynamics between partners and how the stages of life can complicate things. It's charming and funny, but also quite serious, as he certainly doesn't buy into the ideal that movies must have happy endings. In regard to the title, rather than describe Julie, it's more likely meant to explain how many people think of themselves as they make decisions and mistakes - it's really a show of humanity. And quite a good one.Opening in limited theaters on February 4, 2022.","25 February 2022","8/10",NA
"The Worst Person in the World (2021)","Norwegian ""Annie Hall""","evanston_dad","Renate Reinsve is giving one of the performances of the year in this turbulent movie about what it's like being alive.I came home from this and told my wife how much it reminded me of ""Annie Hall"" at times. And then later I was reading a profile of the writer and director, Joachim Trier, which mentioned that ""Annie Hall"" specifically was a huge inspiration for him as a film maker. So there you go.Is Reinsve the worst person in the world? Hardly. She's a warm, loving woman, trying to figure out how to give love to others and yet get what she needs and feels she deserves herself. What happens when those two things seem mutually exclusive? Welcome to human relationships.The movie is very funny in its first half, and then gets very sad in its last half. But it's never emotionally manipulative. It makes the case that it's ok to look out for yourself and your needs, but also that part of growing as a person is learning that the world isn't all about you.Grade: A.","19 January 2022","9/10",NA

In one, the world shifts into 'freeze frame' mode as Julie runs through the streets of Oslo to find her new love, and in the second, we follow her in the midst of a drug hallucination after experimenting with mushrooms. In the story, Trier focuses on the dynamics between partners and how the stages of life can complicate things. It's charming and funny, but also quite serious, as he certainly doesn't buy into the ideal that movies must have happy endings. In regard to the title, rather than describe Julie, it's more likely meant to explain how many people think of themselves as they make decisions and mistakes - it's really a show of humanity. And quite a good one.Opening in limited theaters on February 4, 2022.","25 February 2022","8/10",NA

Not in a way that's going to make me reshape my life or change what I'm doing day to day necessarily, but there was something to it that makes me sure it's going to stick in my brain for weeks, maybe months or even years to come.I can't go much further than that. It's a wonderful, sometimes funny, sometimes bittersweet, sometimes soul-crushing film, and all the emotions are explored and interweaved perfectly.There are so many great scenes... the scene where time freezes, the ""what is cheating"" scene, the scene in and around the hospital, the scene with the magic mushrooms... it's almost like every single chapter in the film is a highlight, and it all fits together almost perfectly.It's a special film- the more I think about it, the better it gets, and the more it resonates.

"The Worst Person in the World (2021)","An Achingly Accurate Portrait Of Millennial Angst","CinemaClown","An achingly human & frighteningly accurate portrait of an entire generation's existential crisis, The Worst Person in the World observes millennial angst through a young woman's quest for love & meaning as she enters into her 30s without any idea about her identity & purpose in life. Crafted with flair & told with utmost honesty, this contemporary rom-com is one of the better films of the year.Co-written & directed by Joachim Trier, the story is narrated in chapters and covers her four years journey of love & enlightenment in which we see her throw herself into different career paths & new relationships yet never going all the way. While most episodes are interesting & aptly address the film's themes, few of them are way too brief and should've been either left out or integrated with others.The first half is lighthearted & brimming with a restless, radiant spirit while the later chapters deal with heavier themes and are treated with required seriousness. Renate Reinsve anchors the film with a performance that hits the right emotional notes and is thoroughly convincing. Anders Danielsen Lie & Herbert Nordrum also chip in with strong support and their chemistry with Reinsve is seamless & spot-on.Overall, The Worst Person in the World is a downright sincere & thoroughly engrossing effort that renders the humanity of its characters with authenticity & compassion. Heartbreaking yet not without hope, this Norwegian dramedy understands the dreaded existential cul-de-sac that comes from not knowing who you are or where you fit in as well as the the crushing feeling of playing a supporting role in your own life story.","16 May 2022","9/10",NA
"The Worst Person in the World (2021)","You were the love of my life.","Pjtaylor-96-138044","'The Worst Person in the World (2021)' is a deeply moving experience. It resonates with me in a way that very few films do. I feel it. It isn't just entertainment, it's something more. Exactly what that is, I can't quite say. Through a seemingly simple story of one woman's life, the picture works its way into your mind, your heart, your soul itself and provokes powerful emotions that you didn't even know movies could provoke; not just sadness or joy or excitement or longing (all of which it provokes in droves), but the kind of emotions that can't be put into words, the kind that weigh on your consciousness and shape your relationship with yourself and the world around you. It's difficult to describe, really, and I'm sure I'm probably slipping into hyperbole. I've lost any sense of objectivity (what little I usually have, at any rate) when it comes to discussing this picture, because its ultimate impact is one that I just can't shake and I'm not sure I ever want to. It's a profoundly affecting affair, one that overcomes any of its initial slowness or slice-of-life limitations, thanks primarily to its uncompromisingly complex nature. It's one of the most honest pieces of fiction I've ever seen, crafting characters who seem like they could walk off the screen and representing reality - or, at least, our lived experience of it - in a way that most kitchen-sink dramas could only dream of doing. It presents a plethora of powerful and often poignant ideas that keenly represent the human condition, all while remembering that its protagonist is the one driving the action and that it owes her a fully-formed narrative that entertains as much as it stirs. Its infrequent formalistic touches are absolutely delightful, but it's the rock-solid 'regular' stuff that matters the most. These moments are told not with style, but with substance; the actors often tell entire libraries worth of stories with their eyes alone. Indeed, this is some of the best acting I've seen in a long time, capable of conveying thought and emotion without so much as a single word. It's often all in the eyes; you could get lost in the pupils of its two leads. The chapter-based structure lends vitality to a plot that may otherwise have felt a little aimless, and the writing is simply divine. The feature just nails everything it sets out to achieve. The more I think about it, the more I like it. It's the sort of thing that proves ratings are insignificant. How can you assign stars to something like this? I can't put my feelings into words, let alone stars. I can't quantify it by the same metrics I use for other films. Even if it isn't as entertaining as the ones I enjoy the most, it's almost certainly much more powerful; very few of them make me feel the way this one does. Maybe another viewing is necessary to determine the picture's true score. Then again, maybe this right here - what I'm feeling right now - is more than enough. It isn't the sort of thing I experience very often; as such, it's a bit hard to process. What else can I say? This is honestly the kind of film that I could see changing your life in one way or another, however small and seemingly insignificant. As I mentioned earlier, it's a deeply moving experience.","29 November 2021","8/10",NA
"The Worst Person in the World (2021)","the story of an imperfect woman","dromasca","The heroine ofJoachim Trier's latest film 'The Worst Person in the World' (2021) is about 30 years old, but she still hasn't managed to find a profession that would give full meaning to her life, or the man she would like to be with and spend the rest of her life, or what could make her happy. It is, if you wish, the film of her searches and the failure of these searches in a hurried and individualistic world. This contemporary Norwegian counter-heroine is one of the most complex and interesting female characters I have seen on screen in recent years. Renate Reinsve's formidable performance brought her a well-deserved award for female performance at the Cannes Film Festival. This is one of the important reasons, but not the only one for which this film is worth seeing.Julie (Renate Reinsve) is an intelligent and intellectually gifted young woman. She starts studying medicine and then gives up, starts studying psychology and abandons this as well, decides to become a photographer and works in parallel and as a bookseller at a bookstore. Her parents are divorced, she is closer to her mother (who is worried about her daughter's un-decisions) while her distant and indifferent father is a negative model that probably makes her wary of relationships with men. And yet she falls in love, not with one man but with two: with a comics book writer and cartoonist about 14 years her senior who wants a child and with a seller at a pastry shop who wants to have fun and maybe to get rid of his previous girlfriend who is more interested by ecology and vegetarianism. Time passes, life advances, but it is not clear in which direction.I guess that one of 'Joachim Trier's sources of inspiration are Woody Allen's older and newer films. The organization of the story in 12 chapters plus a prologue and an epilogue, the well-matched use in this case of off-screen voice, the relationship between lovers separated by age gap, the presence of parents in the lives of mature people, all these they reminded Allen. Even the almost exclusively urban setting seems inspired by his films, with a local touch, of course. If you haven't visited Oslo (like me) by the time you finish watching this movie you will feel the desire to visit this city, which looks colorful, sophisticated, and ... warm (most of the story seems to take place in the summer). The location in time is clear, thanks to the pandemic masks that the characters wear in the epilogue. Just count a few years back. There are at least two chapters in the film with original cinematography that fits well into the logic of the story - the imaginary or real encounter between lovers looking for and finding each other with the rest of the world frozen around and the sequence of the 'experimentation' with hallucinogenic mushrooms. 'The Worst Person in the World' is the story of an imperfect woman with an imperfect life, as are the lives of most of us, a woman who is certainly not the worst person in the world, and the film about her is made interestingly and well acted.

"The Worst Person in the World (2021)","not the usual","ferguson-6","Greetings again from the darkness. It's often fun when an innovative filmmaker turns a stodgy genre upside down and offers us a new take. And who better to flip over the frequently stale mode of romantic-comedies than Norwegian auteur Joachim Trier? Co-written with his frequent collaborator Eskil Vogt, the film could also be described as a dramady or a thirty-ish coming-of-age tale. Regardless of the label, it's entertaining and thought-provoking, as well as being a bit dark in parts (some of these also being quite funny). This is being called the final film in Trier's ""Oslo Trilogy"", three loosely connected films including REPRISE (2006) and OSLO, AUGUST 31 (2011).Each of the films represents quite a shift in tone, and this latest revolves around Julie, played exceptionally well by Renate Reinsve. Trier structures the film as 12 chapters plus a prologue and epilogue. The prologue is brilliant and allows us to quickly grasp what we need to know about Julie. She changes her life goals multiple times - from doctor to psychologist to photographer, and later while working in a bookstore, she decides to be a writer. Thankfully we are spared the details in her essay on oral sex in the #MeToo era. Julie is impulsive to a fault. She has confidence but can't commit to a direction - she's confident in her uncertainty.As she approaches 30, Julie is struggling to find her way. She's not so much lost as struggling to deal with her jumbled thoughts. Can you lose your identity if you haven't yet formed one? That seems to be the crux of Julie's inner-struggles, even as she finds a seemingly good fit for a partner. Aksel (a terrific Anders Danielsen Lie) is a successful graphic artist, and he seems to understand Julie. Their relationship builds over time, even as their individual visions and goals diverge. The best life partner still comes with challenges when you still aren't sure who you are as a person.Julie feels herself slipping away, and that's when her impulsive nature reappears. During a special event for Aksel, she walks out and spontaneously crashes a local wedding reception. This leads to a meet cute and flirty time with Eivind (Herbert Nordrum). Both he and she are in steady relationships, but only Bill Clinton could determine if the time Julie and Eivind spend together is cheating or not. Ms. Reinsve perfectly captures the spirit of Julie. Although she's often a bit flustered, when she does smile, she radiates like a young Shelley Fabares.Much has been made of Ms. Reinsve's performance and she certainly deserves the accolades. However, we shouldn't overlook the outstanding work of Anders Danielsen Lie in a difficult role. Filmmaker Joachim Trier's previous work also includes THELMA (2017) and LOUDER THAN BOMBS (2015), and his creativity is most welcome. Two sequences stand out in his latest. In one, the world shifts into 'freeze frame' mode as Julie runs through the streets of Oslo to find her new love, and in the second, we follow her in the midst of a drug hallucination after experimenting with mushrooms. In the story, Trier focuses on the dynamics between partners and how the stages of life can complicate things. It's charming and funny, but also quite serious, as he certainly doesn't buy into the ideal that movies must have happy endings. In regard to the title, rather than describe Julie, it's more likely meant to explain how many people think of themselves as they make decisions and mistakes - it's really a show of humanity.

"The Northman (2022)","Metal AF 🤘","nathandm-75297","This is without a doubt the most Heavy Metal movie since Mad Max: Fury Road. I'm gonna crank up some Amon Amarth later.Robert Eggers is one of the most exciting and original directors out right now. The Northman is his third full-length film and it just might be my favorite. The Northman is a classic revenge tale (very reminiscent of both Conan The Barbarian and Gladiator) that becomes elevated due to its incredible visuals, uncompromising brutality, fantastic performances, stunning musical score, and authentic depictions of Norse Mythology and Viking history.Although this is probably Eggers's most accessible film (at least in comparison to both The Witch and The Lighthouse) that hardly makes it accessible to most mainstream audiences, which is probably why this film tanked at the box office. But if you love amazing visuals with brutal action sequences and compelling performances, then odds are you're gonna dig The Northman. Its story and themes may not be the most original, but because this film is so technically flawless, the experience that you get in return is well worthwhile.Also, it is absolutely criminal that this movie didn't get any Oscar nominations, ESPECIALLY for best cinematography. I guess this movie was just too metal for the academy voters.","11 December 2022","9/10",NA
"The Northman (2022)","Brutally marvellous.","Sleepin_Dragon","Hate, revenge, fury and spilled blood, a pretty accurate look back at history.It's an era I am truly fascinated by, it's not one that's always accurately portrayed, in the case of The Northman, it felt as though efforts were made to make a fairly accurate set of events.Two things stood out, the visuals, the music, it's a true feast for the senses, visually it is of epic proportions, with incredible use of the landscapes, costumes and special effects, the gore was appropriate, it felt realistic. The music was incredible, and added to the vibe of the film.The acting, on the whole was terrific, Alexander Skarsgård and Claes Bang in particular, I loved the scenes with Bjork too. The only questionable casting decision for me was Nicole Kidman, I felt she was out of place here.Thrilling, exciting, pretty accurate, for a long film it moved by very quickly, 9/10.","26 April 2022","9/10",NA

It was cinema by numbers that added up to far less than its parts. This film should have been absolutely epic. Terribly disappointing. It was well over two hours of boredom.

"The Northman (2022)","It delivered less than I had expected...","paul_haakonsen","Well, the movie's cover/poster definitely was interesting enough to catch my attention.

Sure, it was a watchable movie and entertaining enough for what it was. But don't get your hopes up for this one. If you've seen other Viking movies, or TV series for that matter, then you already know what you are in for here. Yeah, director Robert Eggers didn't deviate much from the how-to-make-a-Viking-saga-movie blueprint.Visually then ""The Northman"" was interesting, as it definitely felt like an era-appropriate movie. I did like the props, costumes, sets, scenery, etc., because it definitely looked and felt like what is usually associated with the Vikings era.""The Northman"" has a good cast ensemble, with the likes of Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Ethan Hawke and even Willem Dafoe. All great talents, sure, but some of them do raise a wondering sensation as to why they were cast for a Viking movie. But on the other hand, I will say that casting Icelandic singer Björk for the movie, despite being a minor role and appearance, was just phenomenal.Something that didn't sit well with me in ""The Northman"", was the fact that it was English language based. Sure, I understand that from a wider appeal to the audience approach. But it just feels wrong having Vikings speak English, it just takes away from the atmosphere and the believability. And also the supernatural aspects were somewhat baffling to me.

It's like a hard-boiled folktale that knows when to be optimistic and when to be cautionary in equal measures; and that's the magic Guillermo Del Toro does so goddamn well in SPADES.This is 2022's best animated feature film, and one of Netflix's best film offerings in years.

Ewan McGregor makes for a terrific comic relief and is an absolute joy to hear whenever he's on screen.David Bradley is so good as Geppetto, subtly bringing so much pain to his character that breaks your heart and makes his moments of happiness all the better to experience.

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)","""Terrible, terrible joy.""","benjaminskylerhill","With less than 1/4 of the budget of the soulless Disney live action remake earlier this year, Del Toro & Co. Have managed to craft a version of Pinocchio with more personality, heart, and soul than Disney could have dreamed of crafting.It injects new life into the character by telling a story that is vastly different both narratively and thematically than any version we've seen on screen before.This tale deals with the malleability of identity, unconditional love, the impressionable nature of children, and the close link between joy and sorrow. And it does so with dark wit, refreshingly complex three-dimensional characters, and stunningly haunting stop-motion animation.However, I do think this could have benefited a bit from cutting down on the plethora of plot points and having Pinocchio and Geppetto spend more time together. This version lacks the tight focus and brisk pacing of the 1940 version.But aside from this, I was thoroughly entranced by this dark fairy tale. It has a spine and a soul, and unlike it's titular protagonist, it's far from wooden.","28 November 2022","8/10",NA
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)","A good film that might not be for everyone","Jeremy_Urquhart","A new Guillermo Del Toro movie is always something worth getting excited about, and I think his take on Pinocchio is another winner. While it might not live up to his very best films, it's another strong addition to his filmography... though it's also worth mentioning that he co-directed this one. Mark Gustafson is the other director, and he's not going to get as much credit as Del Toro, being the lesser-known name. But I imagine you don't get credited as a co-director unless you do a good deal of the work, so he shouldn't go ignored.It's easy to see why this take on the Pinocchio story was appealing to Del Toro. It's a fairly dark fairytale, it deals with child characters in a cruel world, it blends fantasy and real-world conflict (here, it's set in Italy I think either before or at the start of WW2), and it's also a story with big emotions, being heartfelt and also surprisingly sad in places. All these themes/directorial trademarks can be found in Del Toro's other films, which makes this one feel right at home among them (even if it's the first to be animated).The animation looks unique and is great to look at throughout. Unlike other animated movies with unique looks, I didn't feel like this one took a while to get used to. It pulls you in right away, and I think the music helps a great deal, too. It's overall a nice-looking and nice-sounding movie, with pretty good voice-acting, too.The fact that it deals with mature themes (surprising amounts of death and Fascism in this movie) and might look unsettling to some, while also having child-friendly comic relief and music numbers do make it feel a bit odd tonally. I appreciate the effort that went into making this a movie with elements that'll appeal to younger viewers, and elements that'll appeal to older viewers, but I'm not sure the variety of tones is always balanced expertly. If I had any criticism, it's that, but otherwise, this is a very good animated movie, and another triumph for Del Toro (and his co-director!).","23 November 2022","8/10",NA
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)","A delightfully different take","rdoyle29","In case you were wondering what was missing from an adaptation of Pinocchio: 1) more Fascist commentary (not to mention Tom Kenny voicing Mussollini); 2) Frankenstein allusions (or sorry did I say allusions I mean he's clearly so in love with ol' Frank that the imagery is just there in spades); 3) a showstopper Ewan McGregor musical number that hilariously keeps getting interrupted until the ending (you'll hear it at the Oscar's live I bet); 4) the word 'Burden' made existential and harrowing for a child of wood; and 5) and an even more gnarly designed sea beast. It also made me laugh and cry and lay back in awe in my theater - feel lucky if you get a chance to go see theatrical and don't pass it up if you can - at one of the great stop motion animations of my lifetime.I'm sure there are little complaints or nitpicks I can have - ie as strong and believable and emotional an actor Gregory Mann is for the regular scenes, he's slightly one note as a singer for me. But they mostly pale in this giant work of a vision that is collaborative (Jim Henson productions Co produced and I'd love to know if any of this was puppeteers not just with the stop-motion 24fps), yet del Toro's voice and mind and vision is very potent and daring; that of creating a story of Disobedience in the face of the Big Paternal thing of a Fascistic leaders and so called fathers, and a fairy tale in an Iconoclastic approach (meaning as he said at a q&a it doesn't tell you to obey your parents so you'll be a good boy, it says you should be and think for yourself).GDT's Pinocchio is a wonderful hot chocolate that deals with parental grief; why Gepetto creates Pinocchio is a prologue that makes this a film as much about him as the title character and what he has to learn. It's loaded with what we've come to love from Del Toro and his collaborators (Desplat especially), and I hope it reaches families all over the world. How young can you watch it? Uh... how young did you see the Disney one? Go a year younger!","3 December 2022","8/10",NA
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)","What a vision of grief, learning, and being a good person (made of wood)","Quinoa1984","Hot on the heels of the Disney released Tom Hanks starring misfire that has found little fanfare around the world after its release on Disney+, Netflix's high profile and ambitious take on Carlo Collodi's beloved children's tale courtesy of the overseeing of Guillermo del Toro and his co-director Mark Gustafson is an artistic triumph that successful re-imagines the tale of a wooden boy and his creator/father in a way that brings new life and freshness to a story that unquestionably wasn't in need of yet another cinematic adaptation.Transporting the fantastical adventure of Pinocchio (hear voiced by Gregory Mann) from the setting of 1800's Italy to pre-World War 2 Italy under the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini and his National Fascist Party, del Toro and Gustafson's tale is a lot more mature and adult-minded than we've seen most times previously in film versions of this tale but as is to be expected from anything with the Mexican artists touch, the film still manages to offer up whimsy, heart and laughter around all the more serious elements that are sure to affect adult viewers here even more than any little ones that give the film a go.Currently the longest stop-motion feature film ever made, every frame of Pinocchio is a significant feat of artistry come to life and vision explored, with one left wondering how on earth the team behind this effort managed to pull off such exemplary feats of animation to birth this tale into existence and whether its colourful cities, mangy looking monkey sidekicks, rabbit filled underworlds or a belly of a giant sea beast there is no doubt every inch of this Netflix original is right up there with the best of 2022's feats of film-making, making this film as close to a shoe-in as possible for this years Best Animated Film Oscar.While there is so much to enjoy in a visual and aesthetics point of view not everything else in del Toro and Gustafson's film works to the same high level with some of the films infrequent hit and mostly miss humour (a frequently explored joke of Ewan McGregor's mistreated Cricket grows wearisome), hammer over the head reminder that fascism is bad, Mann's slightly irritating voice work of Pinocchio and most tellingly a collection of songs that feel slightly underused and questionable in a sense that perhaps this film might have worked perfectly fine ditching the song and dance numbers all together, combine to stop Pinocchio from operating in other departments as highly and memorably as it does in a purely artistically viewed point of analysis.Undoubtedly Pinocchio can be viewed as a success and head and shoulders above the other 2022 film of the same name but when it comes to what cinematic version of Collodi's tale still remains best, the 1940 Disney animation must still be regarded as the king.Final Say -An outstanding artistic achievement that fails to inspire the same level of magic and awe as its technical prowess elsewhere, Netflix's Pinocchio is a good film that could've been an all round masterpiece if other pieces had come together to reach the same levels of its artistry.3 1/2 hot chocolates out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","12 December 2022","10/10",NA

Finally a film that's number one on Netflix, that deserves to be.I loved the way Geppetto is depicted, he really is a troubled man, even hitting the bottle hard, David Bradley does an awesome job, as do Ewan McGregor and Gregory Mann.The visuals are terrific, it's a beautiful production, it's different to the norm, but it's so impressive, again I think it would appeal to viewers young and old.Take my advice, save it for Christmas day, it's a magical experience, one deserving of the special day.I was expecting to like it, I wasn't expecting to be enchanted by it, it's magical, 10/10.","14 December 2022","7/10",NA

Unfortunately, I don't like this film as much as others do. It's a good film to put on in the background but I found it incredibly hard to pay consistent attention to.Where this film really stands out is in its animation, the stop motion is done very well and the movie has such a unique look to it. The visuals are very dark and fit the gritty tone of the story. There's also some nice colour palettes at times.The film includes a lot of songs, and for the most part I found them fairly forgettable. The voices also sound way too auto-tuned which gets quite annoying. However, the score itself is pretty decent and there's some good sound design, especially at the end where it really adds a lot of emotion to the story.The voice acting from everyone was impressive, but unfortunately I found a lot of the characters to be fairly unlikeable. Ewan McGregor is great as the cricket, and probably my favourite character. Also, Tilda Swinton is perfect and I can't imagine anyone else doing better in her roles. Pinocchio, for me, comes across as very annoying, so it's hard to route for him at times. Additionally, I wasn't keen on Geppetto.The film starts off with a sad and gripping first act, but I slowly lost my interest as the film progressed. I just don't find it entirely engaging and I feel it tries to balance way too many subplots at once, it completely lost me on more than one occasion. Unfortunately for me, I feel this movie drags a lot.","3 February 2023","9/10",NA

Unlike other animated movies with unique looks, I didn't feel like this one took a while to get used to. It pulls you in right away, and I think the music helps a great deal, too. It's overall a nice-looking and nice-sounding movie, with pretty good voice-acting, too.The fact that it deals with mature themes (surprising amounts of death and Fascism in this movie) and might look unsettling to some, while also having child-friendly comic relief and music numbers do make it feel a bit odd tonally. I appreciate the effort that went into making this a movie with elements that'll appeal to younger viewers, and elements that'll appeal to older viewers, but I'm not sure the variety of tones is always balanced expertly. If I had any criticism, it's that, but otherwise, this is a very good animated movie, and another triumph for Del Toro (and his co-director!).","23 November 2022","8/10",NA
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)","A delightfully different take","rdoyle29","In case you were wondering what was missing from an adaptation of Pinocchio: 1) more Fascist commentary (not to mention Tom Kenny voicing Mussollini); 2) Frankenstein allusions (or sorry did I say allusions I mean he's clearly so in love with ol' Frank that the imagery is just there in spades); 3) a showstopper Ewan McGregor musical number that hilariously keeps getting interrupted until the ending (you'll hear it at the Oscar's live I bet); 4) the word 'Burden' made existential and harrowing for a child of wood; and 5) and an even more gnarly designed sea beast. It also made me laugh and cry and lay back in awe in my theater - feel lucky if you get a chance to go see theatrical and don't pass it up if you can - at one of the great stop motion animations of my lifetime.I'm sure there are little complaints or nitpicks I can have - ie as strong and believable and emotional an actor Gregory Mann is for the regular scenes, he's slightly one note as a singer for me. But they mostly pale in this giant work of a vision that is collaborative (Jim Henson productions Co produced and I'd love to know if any of this was puppeteers not just with the stop-motion 24fps), yet del Toro's voice and mind and vision is very potent and daring; that of creating a story of Disobedience in the face of the Big Paternal thing of a Fascistic leaders and so called fathers, and a fairy tale in an Iconoclastic approach (meaning as he said at a q&a it doesn't tell you to obey your parents so you'll be a good boy, it says you should be and think for yourself).GDT's Pinocchio is a wonderful hot chocolate that deals with parental grief; why Gepetto creates Pinocchio is a prologue that makes this a film as much about him as the title character and what he has to learn. It's loaded with what we've come to love from Del Toro and his collaborators (Desplat especially), and I hope it reaches families all over the world. How young can you watch it?

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)","What a vision of grief, learning, and being a good person (made of wood)","Quinoa1984","Hot on the heels of the Disney released Tom Hanks starring misfire that has found little fanfare around the world after its release on Disney+, Netflix's high profile and ambitious take on Carlo Collodi's beloved children's tale courtesy of the overseeing of Guillermo del Toro and his co-director Mark Gustafson is an artistic triumph that successful re-imagines the tale of a wooden boy and his creator/father in a way that brings new life and freshness to a story that unquestionably wasn't in need of yet another cinematic adaptation.Transporting the fantastical adventure of Pinocchio (hear voiced by Gregory Mann) from the setting of 1800's Italy to pre-World War 2 Italy under the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini and his National Fascist Party, del Toro and Gustafson's tale is a lot more mature and adult-minded than we've seen most times previously in film versions of this tale but as is to be expected from anything with the Mexican artists touch, the film still manages to offer up whimsy, heart and laughter around all the more serious elements that are sure to affect adult viewers here even more than any little ones that give the film a go.Currently the longest stop-motion feature film ever made, every frame of Pinocchio is a significant feat of artistry come to life and vision explored, with one left wondering how on earth the team behind this effort managed to pull off such exemplary feats of animation to birth this tale into existence and whether its colourful cities, mangy looking monkey sidekicks, rabbit filled underworlds or a belly of a giant sea beast there is no doubt every inch of this Netflix original is right up there with the best of 2022's feats of film-making, making this film as close to a shoe-in as possible for this years Best Animated Film Oscar.While there is so much to enjoy in a visual and aesthetics point of view not everything else in del Toro and Gustafson's film works to the same high level with some of the films infrequent hit and mostly miss humour (a frequently explored joke of Ewan McGregor's mistreated Cricket grows wearisome), hammer over the head reminder that fascism is bad, Mann's slightly irritating voice work of Pinocchio and most tellingly a collection of songs that feel slightly underused and questionable in a sense that perhaps this film might have worked perfectly fine ditching the song and dance numbers all together, combine to stop Pinocchio from operating in other departments as highly and memorably as it does in a purely artistically viewed point of analysis.Undoubtedly Pinocchio can be viewed as a success and head and shoulders above the other 2022 film of the same name but when it comes to what cinematic version of Collodi's tale still remains best, the 1940 Disney animation must still be regarded as the king.Final Say -An outstanding artistic achievement that fails to inspire the same level of magic and awe as its technical prowess elsewhere, Netflix's Pinocchio is a good film that could've been an all round masterpiece if other pieces had come together to reach the same levels of its artistry.3 1/2 hot chocolates out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","12 December 2022","10/10",NA

Finally a film that's number one on Netflix, that deserves to be.I loved the way Geppetto is depicted, he really is a troubled man, even hitting the bottle hard, David Bradley does an awesome job, as do Ewan McGregor and Gregory Mann.The visuals are terrific, it's a beautiful production, it's different to the norm, but it's so impressive, again I think it would appeal to viewers young and old.Take my advice, save it for Christmas day, it's a magical experience, one deserving of the special day.I was expecting to like it, I wasn't expecting to be enchanted by it, it's magical, 10/10.","14 December 2022","7/10",NA

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)","It grows on me","namie-98193","Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022) follows a father's wish that magically brings a wooden boy to life. Unfortunately, I don't like this film as much as others do. It's a good film to put on in the background but I found it incredibly hard to pay consistent attention to.Where this film really stands out is in its animation, the stop motion is done very well and the movie has such a unique look to it. The visuals are very dark and fit the gritty tone of the story. There's also some nice colour palettes at times.The film includes a lot of songs, and for the most part I found them fairly forgettable. The voices also sound way too auto-tuned which gets quite annoying. However, the score itself is pretty decent and there's some good sound design, especially at the end where it really adds a lot of emotion to the story.The voice acting from everyone was impressive, but unfortunately I found a lot of the characters to be fairly unlikeable. Ewan McGregor is great as the cricket, and probably my favourite character. Also, Tilda Swinton is perfect and I can't imagine anyone else doing better in her roles. Pinocchio, for me, comes across as very annoying, so it's hard to route for him at times. Additionally, I wasn't keen on Geppetto.The film starts off with a sad and gripping first act, but I slowly lost my interest as the film progressed. I just don't find it entirely engaging and I feel it tries to balance way too many subplots at once, it completely lost me on more than one occasion. Unfortunately for me, I feel this movie drags a lot.","3 February 2023","9/10",NA

It's like a hard-boiled folktale that knows when to be optimistic and when to be cautionary in equal measures; and that's the magic Guillermo Del Toro does so goddamn well in SPADES.This is 2022's best animated feature film, and one of Netflix's best film offerings in years.

Ewan McGregor makes for a terrific comic relief and is an absolute joy to hear whenever he's on screen.David Bradley is so good as Geppetto, subtly bringing so much pain to his character that breaks your heart and makes his moments of happiness all the better to experience.

Have managed to craft a version of Pinocchio with more personality, heart, and soul than Disney could have dreamed of crafting.It injects new life into the character by telling a story that is vastly different both narratively and thematically than any version we've seen on screen before.This tale deals with the malleability of identity, unconditional love, the impressionable nature of children, and the close link between joy and sorrow. And it does so with dark wit, refreshingly complex three-dimensional characters, and stunningly haunting stop-motion animation.However, I do think this could have benefited a bit from cutting down on the plethora of plot points and having Pinocchio and Geppetto spend more time together.

But they mostly pale in this giant work of a vision that is collaborative (Jim Henson productions Co produced and I'd love to know if any of this was puppeteers not just with the stop-motion 24fps), yet del Toro's voice and mind and vision is very potent and daring; that of creating a story of Disobedience in the face of the Big Paternal thing of a Fascistic leaders and so called fathers, and a fairy tale in an Iconoclastic approach (meaning as he said at a q&a it doesn't tell you to obey your parents so you'll be a good boy, it says you should be and think for yourself).GDT's Pinocchio is a wonderful hot chocolate that deals with parental grief; why Gepetto creates Pinocchio is a prologue that makes this a film as much about him as the title character and what he has to learn. It's loaded with what we've come to love from Del Toro and his collaborators (Desplat especially), and I hope it reaches families all over the world. How young can you watch it? Uh... how young did you see the Disney one? Go a year younger!","3 December 2022","8/10",NA
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)","What a vision of grief, learning, and being a good person (made of wood)","Quinoa1984","Hot on the heels of the Disney released Tom Hanks starring misfire that has found little fanfare around the world after its release on Disney+, Netflix's high profile and ambitious take on Carlo Collodi's beloved children's tale courtesy of the overseeing of Guillermo del Toro and his co-director Mark Gustafson is an artistic triumph that successful re-imagines the tale of a wooden boy and his creator/father in a way that brings new life and freshness to a story that unquestionably wasn't in need of yet another cinematic adaptation.Transporting the fantastical adventure of Pinocchio (hear voiced by Gregory Mann) from the setting of 1800's Italy to pre-World War 2 Italy under the dictatorship of Benito Mussolini and his National Fascist Party, del Toro and Gustafson's tale is a lot more mature and adult-minded than we've seen most times previously in film versions of this tale but as is to be expected from anything with the Mexican artists touch, the film still manages to offer up whimsy, heart and laughter around all the more serious elements that are sure to affect adult viewers here even more than any little ones that give the film a go.Currently the longest stop-motion feature film ever made, every frame of Pinocchio is a significant feat of artistry come to life and vision explored, with one left wondering how on earth the team behind this effort managed to pull off such exemplary feats of animation to birth this tale into existence and whether its colourful cities, mangy looking monkey sidekicks, rabbit filled underworlds or a belly of a giant sea beast there is no doubt every inch of this Netflix original is right up there with the best of 2022's feats of film-making, making this film as close to a shoe-in as possible for this years Best Animated Film Oscar.While there is so much to enjoy in a visual and aesthetics point of view not everything else in del Toro and Gustafson's film works to the same high level with some of the films infrequent hit and mostly miss humour (a frequently explored joke of Ewan McGregor's mistreated Cricket grows wearisome), hammer over the head reminder that fascism is bad, Mann's slightly irritating voice work of Pinocchio and most tellingly a collection of songs that feel slightly underused and questionable in a sense that perhaps this film might have worked perfectly fine ditching the song and dance numbers all together, combine to stop Pinocchio from operating in other departments as highly and memorably as it does in a purely artistically viewed point of analysis.Undoubtedly Pinocchio can be viewed as a success and head and shoulders above the other 2022 film of the same name but when it comes to what cinematic version of Collodi's tale still remains best, the 1940 Disney animation must still be regarded as the king.Final Say -An outstanding artistic achievement that fails to inspire the same level of magic and awe as its technical prowess elsewhere, Netflix's Pinocchio is a good film that could've been an all round masterpiece if other pieces had come together to reach the same levels of its artistry.3 1/2 hot chocolates out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","12 December 2022","10/10",NA

Finally a film that's number one on Netflix, that deserves to be.I loved the way Geppetto is depicted, he really is a troubled man, even hitting the bottle hard, David Bradley does an awesome job, as do Ewan McGregor and Gregory Mann.The visuals are terrific, it's a beautiful production, it's different to the norm, but it's so impressive, again I think it would appeal to viewers young and old.Take my advice, save it for Christmas day, it's a magical experience, one deserving of the special day.I was expecting to like it, I wasn't expecting to be enchanted by it, it's magical, 10/10.","14 December 2022","7/10",NA

"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)","It grows on me","namie-98193","Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022) follows a father's wish that magically brings a wooden boy to life. Unfortunately, I don't like this film as much as others do. It's a good film to put on in the background but I found it incredibly hard to pay consistent attention to.Where this film really stands out is in its animation, the stop motion is done very well and the movie has such a unique look to it. The visuals are very dark and fit the gritty tone of the story. There's also some nice colour palettes at times.The film includes a lot of songs, and for the most part I found them fairly forgettable. The voices also sound way too auto-tuned which gets quite annoying. However, the score itself is pretty decent and there's some good sound design, especially at the end where it really adds a lot of emotion to the story.The voice acting from everyone was impressive, but unfortunately I found a lot of the characters to be fairly unlikeable. Ewan McGregor is great as the cricket, and probably my favourite character. Also, Tilda Swinton is perfect and I can't imagine anyone else doing better in her roles. Pinocchio, for me, comes across as very annoying, so it's hard to route for him at times. Additionally, I wasn't keen on Geppetto.The film starts off with a sad and gripping first act, but I slowly lost my interest as the film progressed. I just don't find it entirely engaging and I feel it tries to balance way too many subplots at once, it completely lost me on more than one occasion. Unfortunately for me, I feel this movie drags a lot.","3 February 2023","9/10",NA
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)","It's a proverbial mature children's film.","Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","This film is NOT meant to have the light-hearted happy-go-lucky vibes of Disney's 1940 Pinocchio movie, but rather a modernised take praising the wonders of childhood, faith and friendship; up against the all-consuming tyranny of fascism (its take on Mussolini is hilarious), deceptive show-business tactics; and the double-edged sword of Time (and Life) itself.Pinocchio is a conceptually HEAVY film that doesn't condescend on its younger audiences nor it's older ones: it respects all the age groups equally and without compromising the story and fairytale-qualities of the Pinocchio story at its core. It's like a hard-boiled folktale that knows when to be optimistic and when to be cautionary in equal measures; and that's the magic Guillermo Del Toro does so goddamn well in SPADES.This is 2022's best animated feature film, and one of Netflix's best film offerings in years. And it was worth the wait on Del Toro's part too.All in all, Pinocchio was WORTH IT; big time! And hella better than Disney's 2022 live-action turd too.It's a 5/5 star experience.","13 December 2022","10/10",NA
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)","Beautiful interpretation","masonsaul","Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio is exactly that, a beautiful and unique interpretation of a classic that explores death and grief in ways that are often emotional and heartbreaking whilst still delivering a fun adventure with gorgeous animation against a classically disturbing Del Toro backdrop.Gregory Mann gives an incredible lead performance, imbuing Pinocchio with a boundless warmth and naivety that thankfully never becomes annoying. Ewan McGregor makes for a terrific comic relief and is an absolute joy to hear whenever he's on screen.David Bradley is so good as Geppetto, subtly bringing so much pain to his character that breaks your heart and makes his moments of happiness all the better to experience. Rounding out the cast is Christoph Waltz, on point as usual with another truly evil character.Guillermo Del Toro's and Mark Gustafson's direction is absolutely phenomenal, everything from the movement of the characters, to their designs and the vibrant colour palette is gorgeous and endlessly watchable. The music by Alexandre Desplat is amazing, giving the film a perfect sense of whimsy for a fairytale.","10 December 2022","10/10",NA
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)","""Terrible, terrible joy.""","benjaminskylerhill","With less than 1/4 of the budget of the soulless Disney live action remake earlier this year, Del Toro & Co. Have managed to craft a version of Pinocchio with more personality, heart, and soul than Disney could have dreamed of crafting.It injects new life into the character by telling a story that is vastly different both narratively and thematically than any version we've seen on screen before.This tale deals with the malleability of identity, unconditional love, the impressionable nature of children, and the close link between joy and sorrow. And it does so with dark wit, refreshingly complex three-dimensional characters, and stunningly haunting stop-motion animation.However, I do think this could have benefited a bit from cutting down on the plethora of plot points and having Pinocchio and Geppetto spend more time together. This version lacks the tight focus and brisk pacing of the 1940 version.But aside from this, I was thoroughly entranced by this dark fairy tale. It has a spine and a soul, and unlike it's titular protagonist, it's far from wooden.","28 November 2022","8/10",NA
"Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)","A good film that might not be for everyone","Jeremy_Urquhart","A new Guillermo Del Toro movie is always something worth getting excited about, and I think his take on Pinocchio is another winner. While it might not live up to his very best films, it's another strong addition to his filmography... though it's also worth mentioning that he co-directed this one. Mark Gustafson is the other director, and he's not going to get as much credit as Del Toro, being the lesser-known name. But I imagine you don't get credited as a co-director unless you do a good deal of the work, so he shouldn't go ignored.It's easy to see why this take on the Pinocchio story was appealing to Del Toro. It's a fairly dark fairytale, it deals with child characters in a cruel world, it blends fantasy and real-world conflict (here, it's set in Italy I think either before or at the start of WW2), and it's also a story with big emotions, being heartfelt and also surprisingly sad in places. All these themes/directorial trademarks can be found in Del Toro's other films, which makes this one feel right at home among them (even if it's the first to be animated).The animation looks unique and is great to look at throughout. Unlike other animated movies with unique looks, I didn't feel like this one took a while to get used to. It pulls you in right away, and I think the music helps a great deal, too. It's overall a nice-looking and nice-sounding movie, with pretty good voice-acting, too.The fact that it deals with mature themes (surprising amounts of death and Fascism in this movie) and might look unsettling to some, while also having child-friendly comic relief and music numbers do make it feel a bit odd tonally. I appreciate the effort that went into making this a movie with elements that'll appeal to younger viewers, and elements that'll appeal to older viewers, but I'm not sure the variety of tones is always balanced expertly. If I had any criticism, it's that, but otherwise, this is a very good animated movie, and another triumph for Del Toro (and his co-director!).","23 November 2022","8/10",NA

"The Lost Leonardo (2021)","A documentary that plays like a mystery thriller...","tccandler","This documentary is less about whether or not ""Salvator Mundi"" is by Leonardo da Vinci, and more about the shady ways the mega-rich use art as investments, to transport currency, as tax havens, and as political capital.Sadly, none of these super rich people lose money in opaque transactions. The crooks who started it all made 83 million USD. The incompetent curator from the National Gallery in London didn't lose his job after lying about the painting being authenticated, and certainly retained his bribe. The ruthless Russian oligarch not only didn't lose money, as expected, but almost quadrupled it from 120 mil USD to 450 mil USD.It's frustrating and disheartening to see the insatiable greed of those who have more than they know what to do with, but I am glad I watched this documentary, and learned something.","15 March 2022","9/10",NA
"The Lost Leonardo (2021)","Revealing, informative documentary","Valid_ID","The Lost Leonardo recounts one of the most expansive and expensive stories the art world has ever seen. This documentary has a knack of looking at this painting's recent history from a different angle every 20 minutes or so, revealing a whole different facet of the fervor surrounding this single piece of art and how the conversation around it became about so much more than the painting itself.This odyssey of art and commerce begins in a warehouse, where a painting called the Salvator Mundi from one of the masters of the field, Leonardo Da Vinci, was thought to have been lost to time and languishes before being discovered by two art dealers who look for paintings that are worth more than they seem. Little did they know, they just stumbled upon their greatest find in that respect. They purchased the painting for 10,000 dollars and had it restored, in hopes that the work was that of Da Vinci's. The restorer's work supported that conclusion and, with that, a whole new journey with it begins. It ends up selling for hundreds of millions of dollars after it travels the world and comes into contact with everyone from the general public, to art critics, to experts, to Russian billionaires, to wily art dealers and world leaders.Director Andreas Koefoed seems to understand the potential of what he has at his fingertips here - betrayal, treachery, power, greed - it's a winning concoction. For all the goodwill it earns in the riveting way it unfolds, The Lost Leonardo lacks a stylistic backbone to hold the whole thing together. It relies heavily on one-on-one interviews with experts, critics, and those that played in Salvator Mundi's discovery, restoration and sale. Those interviews bear no intimacy to them, which works in giving objectivity to the events documented, but their implementation grows tiresome. Koefoed has little else up his sleeve to tell this story and, for one about art and one of the most prolific pieces in a long time the world over, that's more than disappointing. This film about Salvator Mundi lacks imagination and creativity and is quite staid, which distracts from the gold mine Keofoed has here. Mundi's story certainly is anything but boring; so it's unfortunate that it is told that way.I give The Lost Leonardo 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. Nothing in the movie is objectionable, beyond some nudity shown in the artwork. If you've got an interest in the business of art or the work of Da Vinci, this one's for you. But more than that, the directions this story takes are so unpredictable that I think it makes this documentary easy to recommend to anybody.

"The Lost Leonardo (2021)","For a story about one of the most highly controversial pieces of art, this lacks luster","rannynm","""The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding."" Leonardo da Vinci. William Shakespeare and/or Leonardo da Vinci also once said that ""Eyes are the windows into men's souls"".This documentary about the controversial painting recently attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, ""Salvator Mundi"" (""Savior of the World"") may also show that in the art world, the eyes of a potential master painting may also reveal men's souls, particularly those who may seek to benefit from such an artwork. In other words, the mesmerizing power of a painting's eyes may reveal everything from awe and wonder to contempt and avarice among those involved in the art trading game. Art is not just about beauty but also commerce and even reputations.Most of us laypeople who hear about old master paintings which are auctioned for millions of dollars, euros, or pounds, can only dream of possessing such works. However, those in the middle of the fine art game see things the public rarely glimpses.This documentary reveals how a painting like ""Salvator Mundi"" (c. 1500-1510) have many forces at work among players in a host of different areas: art restorers, art historians, art collectors, art dealers, art auctioneers, museum curators, and even national governments. All are shown to have played a part in the fascinating recent history of ""Salvator Mundi"".The painting was won at auction by two art dealers who are constantly looking for ""sleepers"". ""Sleepers"" in the fine art world refers to misattributed fine art, including paintings and other fine art, which are sold with a misunderstanding of the paintings' origins. In some cases, the artworks turn out to be of much greater importance and in turn of much higher value.Robert Simon and Alexander Parish bought the painting for under $1200 in 2005, the auction house out of New Orleans believing it was simply a copy of a long lost Leonardo da Vinci. Not a real Leonardo, but simply by one of his students, assistants, or maybe even a follower who had not known Leonardo at all. It was described as heavily over-painted and a ""wreck"".They commissioned art historian and restorer Dianne Modestini to restore the painting in two phases. Firstly, to clean and remove the overpaint, and secondly, restore those areas which had been ""lost"".After the restoration, Simon and Parish sought to sell the painting in part to pay for their many expenses, mostly the restoration. Thus begins a strange and winding tale from its placement in the art market, its eventual sale (twice), the last at Christie's Auction House, and then the strange circumstances regarding its being pulled from a Louvre exhibition of works of Leonardo.It begins with art experts, some favorable to the painting with a few unfavorable. There is the Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier who had a Russian oligarch client, Dmitry Rybolovlev. Rybolovlev desired to buy the best paintings on the market. As events unfold, in part because of information regarding Bouvier's business practices, it turns out Bouvier was defrauding his client and others regarding prices he paid for paintings and then for how much he resold them to his clients.It winds up in an auction at Christie's where it sells for a record hammer price of $400 million, plus $50 million in premium/commission for a total of $450 million. The total surpasses the previous auction record of approximately $180 million (hammer) for a fine art piece.But even the high price at the auction is not the end of the story. For a time, no one knew who the buyer was, the Saudi Crown Prince. The Prince agrees to lend the painting to the Louvre for their special Leonardo da Vinci exhibition. But at the last moment, he pulls the painting from the exhibit.What happened? The claim is about national politics (MBS wanted the painting in the same room as the Mona Lisa, aka Giaconda, but the French refused).

"The Lost Leonardo (2021)","Revealing, informative documentary","Valid_ID","The Lost Leonardo recounts one of the most expansive and expensive stories the art world has ever seen. This documentary has a knack of looking at this painting's recent history from a different angle every 20 minutes or so, revealing a whole different facet of the fervor surrounding this single piece of art and how the conversation around it became about so much more than the painting itself.This odyssey of art and commerce begins in a warehouse, where a painting called the Salvator Mundi from one of the masters of the field, Leonardo Da Vinci, was thought to have been lost to time and languishes before being discovered by two art dealers who look for paintings that are worth more than they seem. Little did they know, they just stumbled upon their greatest find in that respect. They purchased the painting for 10,000 dollars and had it restored, in hopes that the work was that of Da Vinci's. The restorer's work supported that conclusion and, with that, a whole new journey with it begins. It ends up selling for hundreds of millions of dollars after it travels the world and comes into contact with everyone from the general public, to art critics, to experts, to Russian billionaires, to wily art dealers and world leaders.Director Andreas Koefoed seems to understand the potential of what he has at his fingertips here - betrayal, treachery, power, greed - it's a winning concoction. For all the goodwill it earns in the riveting way it unfolds, The Lost Leonardo lacks a stylistic backbone to hold the whole thing together. It relies heavily on one-on-one interviews with experts, critics, and those that played in Salvator Mundi's discovery, restoration and sale. Those interviews bear no intimacy to them, which works in giving objectivity to the events documented, but their implementation grows tiresome. Koefoed has little else up his sleeve to tell this story and, for one about art and one of the most prolific pieces in a long time the world over, that's more than disappointing. This film about Salvator Mundi lacks imagination and creativity and is quite staid, which distracts from the gold mine Keofoed has here. Mundi's story certainly is anything but boring; so it's unfortunate that it is told that way.I give The Lost Leonardo 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. Nothing in the movie is objectionable, beyond some nudity shown in the artwork. If you've got an interest in the business of art or the work of Da Vinci, this one's for you. But more than that, the directions this story takes are so unpredictable that I think it makes this documentary easy to recommend to anybody.

"The Lost Leonardo (2021)","For a story about one of the most highly controversial pieces of art, this lacks luster","rannynm","""The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding."" Leonardo da Vinci. William Shakespeare and/or Leonardo da Vinci also once said that ""Eyes are the windows into men's souls"".This documentary about the controversial painting recently attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, ""Salvator Mundi"" (""Savior of the World"") may also show that in the art world, the eyes of a potential master painting may also reveal men's souls, particularly those who may seek to benefit from such an artwork. In other words, the mesmerizing power of a painting's eyes may reveal everything from awe and wonder to contempt and avarice among those involved in the art trading game. Art is not just about beauty but also commerce and even reputations.Most of us laypeople who hear about old master paintings which are auctioned for millions of dollars, euros, or pounds, can only dream of possessing such works. However, those in the middle of the fine art game see things the public rarely glimpses.This documentary reveals how a painting like ""Salvator Mundi"" (c. 1500-1510) have many forces at work among players in a host of different areas: art restorers, art historians, art collectors, art dealers, art auctioneers, museum curators, and even national governments. All are shown to have played a part in the fascinating recent history of ""Salvator Mundi"".The painting was won at auction by two art dealers who are constantly looking for ""sleepers"". ""Sleepers"" in the fine art world refers to misattributed fine art, including paintings and other fine art, which are sold with a misunderstanding of the paintings' origins. In some cases, the artworks turn out to be of much greater importance and in turn of much higher value.Robert Simon and Alexander Parish bought the painting for under $1200 in 2005, the auction house out of New Orleans believing it was simply a copy of a long lost Leonardo da Vinci. Not a real Leonardo, but simply by one of his students, assistants, or maybe even a follower who had not known Leonardo at all. It was described as heavily over-painted and a ""wreck"".They commissioned art historian and restorer Dianne Modestini to restore the painting in two phases. Firstly, to clean and remove the overpaint, and secondly, restore those areas which had been ""lost"".After the restoration, Simon and Parish sought to sell the painting in part to pay for their many expenses, mostly the restoration. Thus begins a strange and winding tale from its placement in the art market, its eventual sale (twice), the last at Christie's Auction House, and then the strange circumstances regarding its being pulled from a Louvre exhibition of works of Leonardo.It begins with art experts, some favorable to the painting with a few unfavorable. There is the Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier who had a Russian oligarch client, Dmitry Rybolovlev. Rybolovlev desired to buy the best paintings on the market. As events unfold, in part because of information regarding Bouvier's business practices, it turns out Bouvier was defrauding his client and others regarding prices he paid for paintings and then for how much he resold them to his clients.It winds up in an auction at Christie's where it sells for a record hammer price of $400 million, plus $50 million in premium/commission for a total of $450 million. The total surpasses the previous auction record of approximately $180 million (hammer) for a fine art piece.But even the high price at the auction is not the end of the story. For a time, no one knew who the buyer was, the Saudi Crown Prince. The Prince agrees to lend the painting to the Louvre for their special Leonardo da Vinci exhibition. But at the last moment, he pulls the painting from the exhibit.What happened? The claim is about national politics (MBS wanted the painting in the same room as the Mona Lisa, aka Giaconda, but the French refused). However, further speculation is that the Louvre examined the painting themselves and may have found some attributes of the painting which may affect its reputation negatively.

"The Lost Leonardo (2021)","A documentary that plays like a mystery thriller...","tccandler","This documentary is less about whether or not ""Salvator Mundi"" is by Leonardo da Vinci, and more about the shady ways the mega-rich use art as investments, to transport currency, as tax havens, and as political capital.Sadly, none of these super rich people lose money in opaque transactions. The crooks who started it all made 83 million USD. The incompetent curator from the National Gallery in London didn't lose his job after lying about the painting being authenticated, and certainly retained his bribe. The ruthless Russian oligarch not only didn't lose money, as expected, but almost quadrupled it from 120 mil USD to 450 mil USD.It's frustrating and disheartening to see the insatiable greed of those who have more than they know what to do with, but I am glad I watched this documentary, and learned something.","15 March 2022","9/10",NA
"The Lost Leonardo (2021)","Revealing, informative documentary","Valid_ID","The Lost Leonardo recounts one of the most expansive and expensive stories the art world has ever seen. This documentary has a knack of looking at this painting's recent history from a different angle every 20 minutes or so, revealing a whole different facet of the fervor surrounding this single piece of art and how the conversation around it became about so much more than the painting itself.This odyssey of art and commerce begins in a warehouse, where a painting called the Salvator Mundi from one of the masters of the field, Leonardo Da Vinci, was thought to have been lost to time and languishes before being discovered by two art dealers who look for paintings that are worth more than they seem. Little did they know, they just stumbled upon their greatest find in that respect. They purchased the painting for 10,000 dollars and had it restored, in hopes that the work was that of Da Vinci's. The restorer's work supported that conclusion and, with that, a whole new journey with it begins. It ends up selling for hundreds of millions of dollars after it travels the world and comes into contact with everyone from the general public, to art critics, to experts, to Russian billionaires, to wily art dealers and world leaders.Director Andreas Koefoed seems to understand the potential of what he has at his fingertips here - betrayal, treachery, power, greed - it's a winning concoction. For all the goodwill it earns in the riveting way it unfolds, The Lost Leonardo lacks a stylistic backbone to hold the whole thing together. It relies heavily on one-on-one interviews with experts, critics, and those that played in Salvator Mundi's discovery, restoration and sale. Those interviews bear no intimacy to them, which works in giving objectivity to the events documented, but their implementation grows tiresome. Koefoed has little else up his sleeve to tell this story and, for one about art and one of the most prolific pieces in a long time the world over, that's more than disappointing. This film about Salvator Mundi lacks imagination and creativity and is quite staid, which distracts from the gold mine Keofoed has here. Mundi's story certainly is anything but boring; so it's unfortunate that it is told that way.I give The Lost Leonardo 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. Nothing in the movie is objectionable, beyond some nudity shown in the artwork. If you've got an interest in the business of art or the work of Da Vinci, this one's for you. But more than that, the directions this story takes are so unpredictable that I think it makes this documentary easy to recommend to anybody.

"The Lost Leonardo (2021)","For a story about one of the most highly controversial pieces of art, this lacks luster","rannynm","""The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding."" Leonardo da Vinci. William Shakespeare and/or Leonardo da Vinci also once said that ""Eyes are the windows into men's souls"".This documentary about the controversial painting recently attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, ""Salvator Mundi"" (""Savior of the World"") may also show that in the art world, the eyes of a potential master painting may also reveal men's souls, particularly those who may seek to benefit from such an artwork. In other words, the mesmerizing power of a painting's eyes may reveal everything from awe and wonder to contempt and avarice among those involved in the art trading game. Art is not just about beauty but also commerce and even reputations.Most of us laypeople who hear about old master paintings which are auctioned for millions of dollars, euros, or pounds, can only dream of possessing such works. However, those in the middle of the fine art game see things the public rarely glimpses.This documentary reveals how a painting like ""Salvator Mundi"" (c. 1500-1510) have many forces at work among players in a host of different areas: art restorers, art historians, art collectors, art dealers, art auctioneers, museum curators, and even national governments. All are shown to have played a part in the fascinating recent history of ""Salvator Mundi"".The painting was won at auction by two art dealers who are constantly looking for ""sleepers"". ""Sleepers"" in the fine art world refers to misattributed fine art, including paintings and other fine art, which are sold with a misunderstanding of the paintings' origins. In some cases, the artworks turn out to be of much greater importance and in turn of much higher value.Robert Simon and Alexander Parish bought the painting for under $1200 in 2005, the auction house out of New Orleans believing it was simply a copy of a long lost Leonardo da Vinci. Not a real Leonardo, but simply by one of his students, assistants, or maybe even a follower who had not known Leonardo at all. It was described as heavily over-painted and a ""wreck"".They commissioned art historian and restorer Dianne Modestini to restore the painting in two phases. Firstly, to clean and remove the overpaint, and secondly, restore those areas which had been ""lost"".After the restoration, Simon and Parish sought to sell the painting in part to pay for their many expenses, mostly the restoration. Thus begins a strange and winding tale from its placement in the art market, its eventual sale (twice), the last at Christie's Auction House, and then the strange circumstances regarding its being pulled from a Louvre exhibition of works of Leonardo.It begins with art experts, some favorable to the painting with a few unfavorable. There is the Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier who had a Russian oligarch client, Dmitry Rybolovlev. Rybolovlev desired to buy the best paintings on the market. As events unfold, in part because of information regarding Bouvier's business practices, it turns out Bouvier was defrauding his client and others regarding prices he paid for paintings and then for how much he resold them to his clients.It winds up in an auction at Christie's where it sells for a record hammer price of $400 million, plus $50 million in premium/commission for a total of $450 million. The total surpasses the previous auction record of approximately $180 million (hammer) for a fine art piece.But even the high price at the auction is not the end of the story. For a time, no one knew who the buyer was, the Saudi Crown Prince. The Prince agrees to lend the painting to the Louvre for their special Leonardo da Vinci exhibition. But at the last moment, he pulls the painting from the exhibit.What happened? The claim is about national politics (MBS wanted the painting in the same room as the Mona Lisa, aka Giaconda, but the French refused). However, further speculation is that the Louvre examined the painting themselves and may have found some attributes of the painting which may affect its reputation negatively. Several people involved try to obtain information from the Louvre, but they hit a brick wall.Overall a wonderfully compelling documentary about the art world, and how it's not just about artistic beautiful but politics and careers.

And that's the point where the movie ""Nope"" starts to unravel, when it can't adequately explain why the protagonists are sticking around.Somewhere between halfway and three fourths of the movie, the dialogue just becomes far too cryptic to make sense of. And that's the point where the actions the protagonists are taking really needs to be clear, as it's the climax of the film.I wished the director Jordan Peele, one half of the successful Key and Peele comedy duo, would try his hand at the horror/comedy movie genre. I believe this is his third and latest film, and the second one that most fits in that genre.To his credit, some sequences have great cinematography, tension, and horror. And some moments are really funny. One particular sequence is both terrifying and hilarious, and best encapsulates the title ""Nope,"" as a main character goes head to head with a massive, intimidating force and just closes his car door, and says ""nope.""But overall, the horror and comedy sides do not feel totally woven together.

""Get Out"" was a masterpiece, while ""Us"" jus didn't do it for me and now ""Nope!""Keke Palmer did her thing in the role she played (she is the star of this movie for sure) and Daniel kept up with a good performance in his own right, but the film itself was something outta the Twilight Zone. More of a sci-fi thriller than a horror flick, it had too many holes and unanswered questions for my liking. Peele's approach to filmmaking is amazing, much like Shyamalan, but the stories, like Shyamalan's are starting to fall short of being good films.Jordan may have dreamt this story and woke up at 5am and jotted down every detail he could remember.

" Nope (2022)","An apt title","darkreignn","The biggest praise I can give is the cinematography and camera work. I really enjoy looking at wide shots of landscapes and the slow or sudden movements of the camera pushing the tension and anxiety of the scene without having to rely on dialogue or even any acting.I think the film will be divisive among its audience though. I think this is due to a couple of reasons. First, the story progression feels confusing at times to what we are used to seeing in a thriller or horror. I think labelling it as horror will automatically steer away some people while those that enjoys horror may be disappointed that it lacks enough scares to be called a horror. The trailer I feel also gives away too much and puts the film in a box that might detract viewers. Ultimately, you really have to be open-minded going to this movie. In respect to the genre, Nope really isn't a horror, but more of a blend of some sci-fi, some mystery, some comedy, and luckily, no romance.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film. I think for movie lovers this will generally be a good experience. Peele seem to focus more on our shared love for films more than sticking to a particular formula of a single genre. There are many small things you'll enjoy if you already love movies, but it will probably have a visibly different experience to a casual movie goer.The themes of the film is also a good one, I feel. It feels like a cautionary modern fairy tale and the somewhat real dangers of chasing fame and disrespecting nature.Jordan Peele is shaping out to be a director whose name alone will generate an audience and I would put Nope as a more captivating experience than Us, and around the same level as Get Out despite being two very different stories. His vision and creativity continues to remain highly interesting and I'm so curious to find out what he goes to work on next!","15 December 2022","3/10",NA
" Nope (2022)","Nope","Prismark10","The credits have just rolled, and despite running for two hours, it's felt as if it's been on for about four hours.I can't remember the last time I was so conflicted about a film, the good elements were great, the bad elements were painful, I'll try to be as concise as I can.I'll start with the great elements, first off, production values are terrific, this is one gorgeously produced film, it looks terrific.The second aspect that stood out, the acting, Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer were terrific, and I really enjoyed Brandon Perea's performance too.The storyline itself was a good one, if nothing highly original, I liked that whole monkey scenario, and the way it developed was very satisfying, the sci fi fan in me appreciated several of the key elements, I loved not knowing exactly what was behind that cloud, that aspect worked well.Unfortunately, it lacked scares, listed as a horror, this was anything but, I wanted thrills and spills, this was more a casual prod. Pacing was definitely an issue, it was just way too slow in parts. Many scenes simply didn't make any sense.It reminded me of The Cloverfield Paradox, definitely some interesting elements, but too slow and just felt too cobbled together.Not bad, but it should have been so much better.5/10.","23 July 2022","5/10",NA
" Nope (2022)","A Fitting Title...","tmccull52","I know Jordan Peele wants to write, direct and produce his own movies and appear like a genius but the writing is horrible here. If he keeps doing this he will end up like Spike Lee, making long movies with lame dialogs that go nowhere.Some of it is just so over the top and some too unrealistic, like the guy they bought the security system from. He was the only cashier in the store and ends up taking a van to do the install at the ranch himself, then he shows pictures of his girlfriend and talks about his life to the customer. Oh and the same guy also remotely monitors the cameras. WHAT?Keke Palmer over acts every scene she's in. It was annoying. Daniel Kaluuya has this look on his face like he smelled somebody's fart at all times. Oh and there is zero siblings chemistry between the two of them and they do not look like siblings, not even by a thousand miles.The acting in this movie is really bad except Steven Yeun, and even the blood looks fake. The attempts at creating tension fail, the attempts at providing humor fail.I was a big fan of Get Out and Us, but Jordan Peele needs to take a break and think about his movie making.","25 July 2022","3/10",NA
" Nope (2022)","Not Sure Where Jordan Was Going","seansoulo73","The amount of reviews calling this pointless and terrible clearly didn't read much into what happens here. Peele is pointing a mirror up to you and the most ironic part is a lot of don't even seem to notice. No, this isn't a typical horror movie. It's more of a Spielbergian blockbuster satire with some amusing moments sprinkled throughout. The ""entity"" is creative and can be quite terrifying. The cinematography is top notch and probably the standout feature of the film, while Kaluuya can say an immense amount without even speaking a word. The screenplay is odd to say the least, but it hits more than it misses.While I still think this is a lesser film than Get Out or Us and it ran a little too long, you have to commend its originality in a summer sea of IP-based films. Peele attempts something profound and unique here, which should be respected regardless of your thoughts on the film.","26 August 2022","6/10",NA

The first hour i was wondering when something was going to happen. The swcond hour I was wondering when it would end.Any attempts at humour fell flat. The acting was just wooden for the most part. The story could of been good but it was just dragged along.I really struggle to find anything good to say about it. In retrospect I'd of been better of watching ""Get Out"" or ""Us"" again. They are great movies. This is not even close to those standards.Seriously not recommended. Not even just to watch once. It's over 2 hours and could of been covered in an hour or less.","22 August 2022","2/10",NA
" Nope (2022)","Slow,over-hyped,boring","Misss25","I surmise that the idea for ""Nope"" came out of a clever idea for a sketch. Imagine a film where the main character says ""Nope"" to terrifying, unexplainable phenomena instead of rushing forward like a courageous, but dumb movie hero.Except, bucking that trope only takes a movie so far. And that's the point where the movie ""Nope"" starts to unravel, when it can't adequately explain why the protagonists are sticking around.Somewhere between halfway and three fourths of the movie, the dialogue just becomes far too cryptic to make sense of. And that's the point where the actions the protagonists are taking really needs to be clear, as it's the climax of the film.I wished the director Jordan Peele, one half of the successful Key and Peele comedy duo, would try his hand at the horror/comedy movie genre. I believe this is his third and latest film, and the second one that most fits in that genre.To his credit, some sequences have great cinematography, tension, and horror. And some moments are really funny. One particular sequence is both terrifying and hilarious, and best encapsulates the title ""Nope,"" as a main character goes head to head with a massive, intimidating force and just closes his car door, and says ""nope.""But overall, the horror and comedy sides do not feel totally woven together. It's like at some point budget was lost and some sequences just couldn't get follow through. And the characters had to be stretched to make up for missing plot points, or fill the moments with comedy. The writers and actors and visual effects teams are good enough so they manage it. But there is a sense of ""what did I just watch"" at the ending, which wasn't there with Peele's two other more finished films.Whatever the back story is that has given ""Nope"" its rough landing, I still found the film enjoyable. Sometimes experimental. Mostly unpretentious and original good fun. But also, what did I just watch?","22 July 2022","2/10",NA
" Nope (2022)","YEP (spoilers after a warning)","FeastMode","Jordan Peele's Nope has been compared to a Spielberg extravaganza such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind.Conceptually it is closer to M Night Shyamalan. With a central premise about fame.Some of the characters have been involved in the tv and film industry. Others are chasing fame such as news and reality tv.OJ (Daniel Kaluuya) is a rancher and horse wrangler. Together with his sister Emerald (Keke Palmer) they need to do something about their struggling business after the sudden death of their father who was hit by some falling debris.There are the strange death of their horses. They have had to sell some horses to their neighbour Ricky 'Jupe' Park (Steven Yeun) a former child actor who now operates a Western theme park.The possibility of UFO activity out there could be the sibling's salvation. Hoping to recapture footage of the impossible could be a way to make a fortune.Like a Shyamalan movie, Nope is told in a leisurely pace like some modern western before the horror/sci fi part cranks up.It is not without flaws. I am bemused why Emerald sounds like some person who grew up in the hood. It is jarring.When the alien attacks takes place, there is a lack of law enforcement, army and media activity.Jupe's past as a child actor where a chimpanzee went on a rampage sits oddly. It was like walking into a David Lynch film.Nope is odd, stilted and strangely beguiling. It is hard to overlook the flaws.","15 April 2023","8/10",NA
" Nope (2022)","Rough cut horror/comedy has good moments","Hallelujah289","I hope we are not about to see the Shyamalan effect with Jordan Peele, where the debut film is amazing and everything that follows leaves you scratching your head. I feel like I'm on that road with Peele's body of silver screen work. ""Get Out"" was a masterpiece, while ""Us"" jus didn't do it for me and now ""Nope!""Keke Palmer did her thing in the role she played (she is the star of this movie for sure) and Daniel kept up with a good performance in his own right, but the film itself was something outta the Twilight Zone. More of a sci-fi thriller than a horror flick, it had too many holes and unanswered questions for my liking. Peele's approach to filmmaking is amazing, much like Shyamalan, but the stories, like Shyamalan's are starting to fall short of being good films.Jordan may have dreamt this story and woke up at 5am and jotted down every detail he could remember. And like our weird dreams, they never make any sense and we forget a lot of the details by the time we wake up! Nope was like one of those weird a... dreams!","23 July 2022","6/10",NA
" Nope (2022)","An apt title","darkreignn","The biggest praise I can give is the cinematography and camera work. I really enjoy looking at wide shots of landscapes and the slow or sudden movements of the camera pushing the tension and anxiety of the scene without having to rely on dialogue or even any acting.I think the film will be divisive among its audience though. I think this is due to a couple of reasons. First, the story progression feels confusing at times to what we are used to seeing in a thriller or horror. I think labelling it as horror will automatically steer away some people while those that enjoys horror may be disappointed that it lacks enough scares to be called a horror. The trailer I feel also gives away too much and puts the film in a box that might detract viewers. Ultimately, you really have to be open-minded going to this movie. In respect to the genre, Nope really isn't a horror, but more of a blend of some sci-fi, some mystery, some comedy, and luckily, no romance.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film. I think for movie lovers this will generally be a good experience. Peele seem to focus more on our shared love for films more than sticking to a particular formula of a single genre. There are many small things you'll enjoy if you already love movies, but it will probably have a visibly different experience to a casual movie goer.The themes of the film is also a good one, I feel. It feels like a cautionary modern fairy tale and the somewhat real dangers of chasing fame and disrespecting nature.Jordan Peele is shaping out to be a director whose name alone will generate an audience and I would put Nope as a more captivating experience than Us, and around the same level as Get Out despite being two very different stories. His vision and creativity continues to remain highly interesting and I'm so curious to find out what he goes to work on next!","15 December 2022","3/10",NA
" Nope (2022)","Nope","Prismark10","The credits have just rolled, and despite running for two hours, it's felt as if it's been on for about four hours.I can't remember the last time I was so conflicted about a film, the good elements were great, the bad elements were painful, I'll try to be as concise as I can.I'll start with the great elements, first off, production values are terrific, this is one gorgeously produced film, it looks terrific.The second aspect that stood out, the acting, Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer were terrific, and I really enjoyed Brandon Perea's performance too.The storyline itself was a good one, if nothing highly original, I liked that whole monkey scenario, and the way it developed was very satisfying, the sci fi fan in me appreciated several of the key elements, I loved not knowing exactly what was behind that cloud, that aspect worked well.Unfortunately, it lacked scares, listed as a horror, this was anything but, I wanted thrills and spills, this was more a casual prod. Pacing was definitely an issue, it was just way too slow in parts. Many scenes simply didn't make any sense.It reminded me of The Cloverfield Paradox, definitely some interesting elements, but too slow and just felt too cobbled together.Not bad, but it should have been so much better.5/10.","23 July 2022","5/10",NA
" Nope (2022)","A Fitting Title...","tmccull52","I know Jordan Peele wants to write, direct and produce his own movies and appear like a genius but the writing is horrible here. If he keeps doing this he will end up like Spike Lee, making long movies with lame dialogs that go nowhere.Some of it is just so over the top and some too unrealistic, like the guy they bought the security system from. He was the only cashier in the store and ends up taking a van to do the install at the ranch himself, then he shows pictures of his girlfriend and talks about his life to the customer. Oh and the same guy also remotely monitors the cameras. WHAT?Keke Palmer over acts every scene she's in. It was annoying. Daniel Kaluuya has this look on his face like he smelled somebody's fart at all times. Oh and there is zero siblings chemistry between the two of them and they do not look like siblings, not even by a thousand miles.The acting in this movie is really bad except Steven Yeun, and even the blood looks fake. The attempts at creating tension fail, the attempts at providing humor fail.I was a big fan of Get Out and Us, but Jordan Peele needs to take a break and think about his movie making.","25 July 2022","3/10",NA
" Nope (2022)","Not Sure Where Jordan Was Going","seansoulo73","The amount of reviews calling this pointless and terrible clearly didn't read much into what happens here. Peele is pointing a mirror up to you and the most ironic part is a lot of don't even seem to notice. No, this isn't a typical horror movie. It's more of a Spielbergian blockbuster satire with some amusing moments sprinkled throughout. The ""entity"" is creative and can be quite terrifying. The cinematography is top notch and probably the standout feature of the film, while Kaluuya can say an immense amount without even speaking a word. The screenplay is odd to say the least, but it hits more than it misses.While I still think this is a lesser film than Get Out or Us and it ran a little too long, you have to commend its originality in a summer sea of IP-based films. Peele attempts something profound and unique here, which should be respected regardless of your thoughts on the film.","26 August 2022","6/10",NA

I saw where some reviewers were complaining about him not looking closely enough like Elvis but I thought he was a nice fit. There was only one Elvis folks.

"Elvis (2022)","Austin Butler a 10/10 Baz Luhrmann a 7.5 /10","tm-sheehan","My Review Baz Lurhmann's - ElvisMy Rating 7.5 /1010/10 for Austin Butler's portrayal as ElvisElvis has the Baz Lurhmann brand all over it as it's bound to seeing Baz wrote the story as well as Directed and Produced the movie . Whether that's a good thing or not I'm not so sure but top marks for his choice of Austin Butler to play the title role of Elvis Presley.Austin Butler had big shoes to fill and Elvis fans won't be disappointed as he portrays the iconic singer over more than 20 years of his life covering the 50s, 60s, and 70s, eras from his childhood and meteoric rise to stardom to his long, slow decline.This biographical movie unlike the 2019 movie Judy I'm pleased to say covers the good years as well as the sad years when Elvis left us tragically aged only 42 under identical circumstances to Judy Garland who was 47.Both stars burnt out prematurely both were exploited but their fame and legacy of music and film footage will live on for centuries as they are both true historical cultural icons.Austin Butler really does hold the entire movie together for me he gives much more than an Elvis impersonation which so many performers have done before.At times and at certain camera angles Austin Butler looks uncannily identical to Elvis Presley and he sings the early Elvis songbook in his own voice to perfection. Austin's voice is only blended with Elvis's own voice in the later Las Vegas years .Many other actors in addition to Austin Butler auditioned for the role including Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Harry Styles but the right choice to play Elvis certainly was Austin Butler in my opinion.Unlike Rami Malik who played Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody and had the Freddie Mercury teeth he wore cast in gold , Austin Butler's transformation really just relies on eye make up ,hairstyle and the tight pants and flamboyant shirts and capes that Elvis wore during his performances.I'm certain Austin Butler's performance is what prompted the Elvis movie to receive a 12 minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival last month. Rami Malik received an Oscar and lip synched the songs so Austin Butler who sings in his own voice should at least get a Best Actor Oscar nomination in 2023.There were positives I liked in Baz Luhrmann's Elvis and negatives as much as I admire Tom Hanks as an Actor the role of Colonel Tom Parker who is the storyteller through whose eyes we see the rise and fall of The King of Rock is a despicable and ugly character . While of course he is a central character in the Elvis Presley story I felt telling the story through such an unsympathetic character was unnecessary and I found Tom Hanks Dutch accent and his prosthetic nose a little irritating at times.The Cinematography by Mandy Walker is stunning as are the costumes by Baz Luhrmann's 4 time Academy Award winning wife Catherine Martin .All biography movies stretch or modify the facts to a certain extent to add more dramatic content and while this story is reasonably accurate Baz has used some poetic licence in some scenes . The emotional meeting of Elvis and the Producer Steve Binder of his 1968 Christmas comeback show at the iconic rusting L. A. Hollywood sign never happened but it's effective.The opening introduction scene of Colonel Tom Parker discovering Elvis at the Carnival which I'm sure was inspired by Guillermo del Toro's recent movie Nightmare Alley also never occurred. World events of that time are used as a timeline like the assassination of Bobby Kennedy during taping of an Elvis television show also are fiction but it does add drama to the script.There's also a silly hysterical scene where an entire Christmas snow set is built to convince The Colonel that Elvis was going to sing Here Comes Santa Claus in his 1968 comeback show this also apparently was a complete fiction as was the fact that Elvis was persuaded by Parker to enlist in the army rather than being arrested for his suggestive stage gyrations. Elvis did not enlist he was drafted and surrounded by the media when he entered the Army in March 1958.Those who love Showman Baz Luhrmann's flamboyant highly individual directing style I'm sure will love Elvis I enjoyed it but didn't love it.The supporting cast that includes Olivia De Jonge as Pricilla Richard Roxburgh as Vernon Presley Helen Thomson as Gladys and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Jimmie Rodgers Snow are all good but in my view could have been featured more .I personally think he lacks subtlety and while putting on a great show his script in this case focuses to much on the character of Colonel Tom Parker and as I recently referred to heroes as main characters in stories Colonel Tom Parker was no hero. Colonel Tom reminds me more of Rumpelstiltskin in more ways than one Elvis turned the straw that Colonel Tom Parker gave him into gold and like the Princess in the Grimm's Fairy Tale sadly Elvis paid a very high price.","4 July 2022","7/10",NA
"Elvis (2022)","Entertaining, But Can't Get Out Of Its Own Way Enough To Be Great","zkonedog","There are certainly times in which Baz Luhrmann's ""Elvis"" is an engaging and entertaining biopic of rock-and-roll's biggest star. The performance numbers are often incredible and Austin Butler inhabits all aspects/ages of the lead role adeptly. Unfortunately, Luhrmann's let's say ""unique"" style of filmmaking can't quite get out of its way long enough (especially in the early goings) for this to be a top-notch flick.For a very basic overview, ""Elvis"" tells the story of the titular character (played by Butler) from childhood all the way through his Vegas residency at the end of his career. The narrative frame comes from the voice of Colonel Parker (Tom Hanks), Presley's manager and quasi-abuser (largely in the financial department). Elvis's relationship to ""black music"", teen heartthrob fame, military service, and late-60s comeback are all given time here, including his marriage to Priscilla (Olivia DeJonge).Perhaps the most notable thing to mention about ""Elvis"" is that the first 30-45 minutes are kind of a mess. Luhrmann is in peak wackadoodle form (granted, what else could be expected from the director of 1996's ""Romeo + Juliet""), what with jarring time-cuts, crazy montages (one that turns the proceedings into a comic book!), and quite a bit of time spent on the bizarre Hanks Parker portrayal. There is also a far-too-on-the-nose scene in which a young Presley supposedly learns his later musical style via an R&B jam session and a revival ministry happening concurrently. I'd blame no one for thinking this was a total mess before the 1 hour mark.Fortunately, in this case, there is still 2 hours left of ""Elvis"", and that's when it settles into being a pretty entertaining film. Basically, once all the crazy material is out of the way and audiences can just settle into Butler's portrayal, there is a lot to like. I was really impressed with Butler's ability to portray the young rebellious Elvis, as well as the fat, worn-down-by-life version. The staged musical numbers are every bit as good as those found in recent musical biopics like Rocketman or Bohemian Rhapsody. I'll certainly be revisiting some Presley tunes after seeing this.Overall, I can't put ""Elvis"" in my top tier (Walk the Line, Love & Mercy, & Judy) of biopics because its director seems almost physically unable to ""tell it straight"" when this film and acting performances would have certainly been good enough for that grounded approach. But it was easily good enough to hold my interest and take me on an interesting journey through the iconic musician's entire career.","22 June 2022","7/10",NA
"Elvis (2022)","Incredibly exciting and a roller coaster of emotions! Incredible performance by Austin Butler","rannynm","What a mess.... nearly incoherent storyline. Over 2.5 hours of film, yet after watching you know Elvis no better. It's simply a bunch scenes strung together, accompanied by music, but little to no plot and a complete lack of interesting dialog. The film feels almost like a bad fever dream, arbitrarily switching from scene to scene with little to no connection. Too much attention is put in Parker/Hanks, when he's not narrating he's the focus of every scene he's in. Thankfully Austin Butler and Olivia DeJonge do everything they can to save the train wreck, they still can only do so much, but both are fantastic with what they were given. The music varies, at times it's fantastic, others it's inappropriate and awkward.Absolute waste of Austin Butlers performance.","8 August 2022","10/10",NA
"Elvis (2022)","Big bright shiny vapidness...","slak96u","For the first two hours it felt like I was watching the longest music video of all time. It was all over the place and extremely rushed. And what was up with the soundtrack? Why the hell was there a Backstreet Boys song in the film? Not to mention the Hip Hop? I didn't get it. This film was hard to get through and I couldn't take Austin Butler serious. I was glad when it was over. I guess if you're a fan of Elvis give it a shot. If not, pass on it, it's nothing special. Basic 5 star film.","18 August 2022","5/10",NA
"Elvis (2022)","Totally Overrated","Draysan-Jennings","For me Tom Hanks looked and sounded ridiculous. His makeup was absurd and his voice was irritating. Austin looked good and the wardrobe was ok but the movie was one long muddled weird music video. For some reason they portrayed Elvis as a whiny wimpy immature baby and that was not what I had heard he was like especially from my father who did a movie with him. This movie is really terrible. The entire first 20 minutes is a total waste of time. I think putting Tom Hanks in any role in any movie is just too hard to not just see Tom Hanks! And I was way done with this movie after an hour but for some reason it just kept going on and on. Ugh really terrible!","5 September 2022","5/10",NA
"Elvis (2022)","Ugh Tom Hanks","hpcmakeup","I guess this movie has been made for millenials who do not know nor even care who Elvis was and maybe never listened any of his songs. Elvis 2.0? No, thank you. More an update of Freaks, this three rings Elvis circus is visually very similar to Moulin rouge or The great Gatsby. Sort of loud colorful nightmare and shamely clearly made for pecuniary purposes only. A dirty unpleasant look with lots of pastiche colors, disgusting cartoonish characters, impact dramatic effects, dirty mind plot tricks and constant fast jumps. The script is poor and unaccurate but provides all kind of low dirty tabloid stuff to appeal the kind of audiences it is addressed to.If you like Elvis songs and music go for 1979 Elvis movie. Kurt Russell just provides the best performance I have ever seen of Elvis. He IS Elvis and by watching the movie you feel you are really watching Elvis.

"Elvis (2022)","Grotesque grand guignol exploitation film","MegaSuperstar","Austin Butler's performance as Elvis Presley is quite literally the only saving grace in this whole godforsaken movie.Not even Butler's inspired performance could save this absolute dumpster fire of a film. Elvis is one of the most vapid, obnoxious, superficial, headache-inducing movies I've seen in I didn't even know how long. Elvis is so bad that it actually makes Bryan Singer's Bohemian Rhapsody look like a masterpiece. I despise this movie, and I knew that I would which was why I put off watching it for so long.Baz Luhrmann is one of the very few filmmakers that I legitimately loathe. Both Romeo and Juliet and The Great Gadsby were two of the most cringe-inducing films I've ever seen. To say that Luhrmann's movies are all style and no substance would be the understatement of the century. I knew within 10 minutes of watching Elvis that Luhrmann had no genuine intentions of telling an authentic and mature story about Elvis Presley. Instead, he was more focused on making a 2 and a half hour music video that has even less depth and heart than Elvis's Wikipedia page.Baz Luhrmann's directing style is so aggressively annoying that it feels like he's trying to cater this movie to an audience of ADHD-stricken toddlers. The editing in this film felt like it was done by cokeheads. Most shots in this movie lasted less than 5 seconds. I know that because I counted. This movie cannot sit still. On top of that, there is the classic Luhrmann trademark of adding crappy pop and rap music to all of his films which never works and always feels out of place. This movie even went as far as taking Elvis' songs and remixing them with random modern pop artists. The most nauseating example of this was when they remixed Viva Las Vegas with Britney Spears' Toxic. I'm not kidding.This movie feels like a bad joke. All the authenticity that was desperately needed in order for the film to have any sort of emotional impact gets completely wiped out by Luhrmann's overly flashy visual nonsense. I felt nothing watching this movie, even in its most dramatic moments.There were numerous times when this movie went full-on Dewey Cox and didn't even see the irony. And don't get me started on Tom Hanks, oh boy. What happened Tom? This is easily the worst Tom Hanks has ever been in a movie, EVER. I challenge anyone to find me another Tom Hanks movie where he sucked this hard. It was beyond embarrassing.Out of all the best picture-nominated films I've seen in my lifetime, Elvis just might be the very worst. This is an awful movie in practically every regard.","16 February 2023","1/10",NA
"Elvis (2022)","Incredibly Annoying","nathandm-75297","Looks like Tom Hanks phoned in his role. His acting, if you can call it that was disgustingly terrible. Austin Butler was the perfect actor to play Elvis. I enjoyed the parts of the movie that he was in without Hanks hovering around trying to steal the scene. The writers needed to delve more into Elvis Presley's early life. Priscilla's character was just a footnote. It was if she was hardly in his life. I would actually watch this movie again if I could delete Tom Hanks from the film. Tom Hanks sucked the life out of the movie as much as Colonel Parker sucked the life out of Elvis Presley and his career.","18 September 2022","1/10",NA
"Elvis (2022)","Too Much Colonel, Not Enough Elvis","noladel","Apart from the inevitable ""Lurhmanization"" as in excessive, baroque, disjointed narrative and bombastic soundtrack, this movie suffers from a case of banality masked as originality.The main message conveyed, according to woke standards, is that Elvis was a wimp who stole black music and was manipulated by ""Colonel"" Parker all his life and that old, white people are bad.After the hallucinatory, nausea-inducing intro focussed on Colonel Parker, the first part of the film, with plenty of gospel and black nightclubbing, looks more like an anti-segregation documentary than an Elvis biopic. Nothing wrong with that, if it was on a movie about the influence of gospel and rhythm and blues on rock'n'roll, but this is about Elvis... or is it?The second part of the movie drags on, with compulsory scenes already seen a billion times in every movie about rock'n'roll, about the old, white male establishment being shocked by Elvis and his pelvis and a totally unnecessary repetition of some of the songs already played in the first part. The third act gallantly speeds over Elvis' last years as an ddict and a parody of himself in Vegas.Austin Butler did a great job but that's about it. Everything else feels wrong: the editing is beyond annoying with cuts of 20 seconds and faster, disorienting takes, and gyrating moving shots; Hanks as Parker is unconvincing to say the least but worst of all, the soundtrack is sub-pair, with very few original songs that get repeated during the movie (because Elvis didn't have enough material?) and even polluted by rap, winking to the woke audience.","1 November 2022","6/10",NA

Unfortunately, Luhrmann's let's say ""unique"" style of filmmaking can't quite get out of its way long enough (especially in the early goings) for this to be a top-notch flick.For a very basic overview, ""Elvis"" tells the story of the titular character (played by Butler) from childhood all the way through his Vegas residency at the end of his career. The narrative frame comes from the voice of Colonel Parker (Tom Hanks), Presley's manager and quasi-abuser (largely in the financial department). Elvis's relationship to ""black music"", teen heartthrob fame, military service, and late-60s comeback are all given time here, including his marriage to Priscilla (Olivia DeJonge).Perhaps the most notable thing to mention about ""Elvis"" is that the first 30-45 minutes are kind of a mess. Luhrmann is in peak wackadoodle form (granted, what else could be expected from the director of 1996's ""Romeo + Juliet""), what with jarring time-cuts, crazy montages (one that turns the proceedings into a comic book!), and quite a bit of time spent on the bizarre Hanks Parker portrayal. There is also a far-too-on-the-nose scene in which a young Presley supposedly learns his later musical style via an R&B jam session and a revival ministry happening concurrently. I'd blame no one for thinking this was a total mess before the 1 hour mark.Fortunately, in this case, there is still 2 hours left of ""Elvis"", and that's when it settles into being a pretty entertaining film. Basically, once all the crazy material is out of the way and audiences can just settle into Butler's portrayal, there is a lot to like. I was really impressed with Butler's ability to portray the young rebellious Elvis, as well as the fat, worn-down-by-life version. The staged musical numbers are every bit as good as those found in recent musical biopics like Rocketman or Bohemian Rhapsody. I'll certainly be revisiting some Presley tunes after seeing this.Overall, I can't put ""Elvis"" in my top tier (Walk the Line, Love & Mercy, & Judy) of biopics because its director seems almost physically unable to ""tell it straight"" when this film and acting performances would have certainly been good enough for that grounded approach. But it was easily good enough to hold my interest and take me on an interesting journey through the iconic musician's entire career.","22 June 2022","7/10",NA
"Elvis (2022)","Incredibly exciting and a roller coaster of emotions! Incredible performance by Austin Butler","rannynm","What a mess.... nearly incoherent storyline. Over 2.5 hours of film, yet after watching you know Elvis no better. It's simply a bunch scenes strung together, accompanied by music, but little to no plot and a complete lack of interesting dialog. The film feels almost like a bad fever dream, arbitrarily switching from scene to scene with little to no connection. Too much attention is put in Parker/Hanks, when he's not narrating he's the focus of every scene he's in. Thankfully Austin Butler and Olivia DeJonge do everything they can to save the train wreck, they still can only do so much, but both are fantastic with what they were given. The music varies, at times it's fantastic, others it's inappropriate and awkward.Absolute waste of Austin Butlers performance.","8 August 2022","10/10",NA

This film was hard to get through and I couldn't take Austin Butler serious. I was glad when it was over. I guess if you're a fan of Elvis give it a shot. If not, pass on it, it's nothing special. Basic 5 star film.","18 August 2022","5/10",NA

Austin looked good and the wardrobe was ok but the movie was one long muddled weird music video. For some reason they portrayed Elvis as a whiny wimpy immature baby and that was not what I had heard he was like especially from my father who did a movie with him. This movie is really terrible. The entire first 20 minutes is a total waste of time. I think putting Tom Hanks in any role in any movie is just too hard to not just see Tom Hanks!

No, thank you. More an update of Freaks, this three rings Elvis circus is visually very similar to Moulin rouge or The great Gatsby. Sort of loud colorful nightmare and shamely clearly made for pecuniary purposes only. A dirty unpleasant look with lots of pastiche colors, disgusting cartoonish characters, impact dramatic effects, dirty mind plot tricks and constant fast jumps. The script is poor and unaccurate but provides all kind of low dirty tabloid stuff to appeal the kind of audiences it is addressed to.If you like Elvis songs and music go for 1979 Elvis movie.

"Elvis (2022)","Grotesque grand guignol exploitation film","MegaSuperstar","Austin Butler's performance as Elvis Presley is quite literally the only saving grace in this whole godforsaken movie.Not even Butler's inspired performance could save this absolute dumpster fire of a film. Elvis is one of the most vapid, obnoxious, superficial, headache-inducing movies I've seen in I didn't even know how long. Elvis is so bad that it actually makes Bryan Singer's Bohemian Rhapsody look like a masterpiece. I despise this movie, and I knew that I would which was why I put off watching it for so long.Baz Luhrmann is one of the very few filmmakers that I legitimately loathe. Both Romeo and Juliet and The Great Gadsby were two of the most cringe-inducing films I've ever seen. To say that Luhrmann's movies are all style and no substance would be the understatement of the century. I knew within 10 minutes of watching Elvis that Luhrmann had no genuine intentions of telling an authentic and mature story about Elvis Presley. Instead, he was more focused on making a 2 and a half hour music video that has even less depth and heart than Elvis's Wikipedia page.Baz Luhrmann's directing style is so aggressively annoying that it feels like he's trying to cater this movie to an audience of ADHD-stricken toddlers. The editing in this film felt like it was done by cokeheads. Most shots in this movie lasted less than 5 seconds. I know that because I counted. This movie cannot sit still. On top of that, there is the classic Luhrmann trademark of adding crappy pop and rap music to all of his films which never works and always feels out of place. This movie even went as far as taking Elvis' songs and remixing them with random modern pop artists. The most nauseating example of this was when they remixed Viva Las Vegas with Britney Spears' Toxic. I'm not kidding.This movie feels like a bad joke. All the authenticity that was desperately needed in order for the film to have any sort of emotional impact gets completely wiped out by Luhrmann's overly flashy visual nonsense. I felt nothing watching this movie, even in its most dramatic moments.There were numerous times when this movie went full-on Dewey Cox and didn't even see the irony. And don't get me started on Tom Hanks, oh boy. What happened Tom? This is easily the worst Tom Hanks has ever been in a movie, EVER. I challenge anyone to find me another Tom Hanks movie where he sucked this hard. It was beyond embarrassing.Out of all the best picture-nominated films I've seen in my lifetime, Elvis just might be the very worst. This is an awful movie in practically every regard.","16 February 2023","1/10",NA
"Elvis (2022)","Incredibly Annoying","nathandm-75297","Looks like Tom Hanks phoned in his role. His acting, if you can call it that was disgustingly terrible. Austin Butler was the perfect actor to play Elvis. I enjoyed the parts of the movie that he was in without Hanks hovering around trying to steal the scene. The writers needed to delve more into Elvis Presley's early life. Priscilla's character was just a footnote. It was if she was hardly in his life. I would actually watch this movie again if I could delete Tom Hanks from the film. Tom Hanks sucked the life out of the movie as much as Colonel Parker sucked the life out of Elvis Presley and his career.","18 September 2022","1/10",NA
"Elvis (2022)","Too Much Colonel, Not Enough Elvis","noladel","Apart from the inevitable ""Lurhmanization"" as in excessive, baroque, disjointed narrative and bombastic soundtrack, this movie suffers from a case of banality masked as originality.The main message conveyed, according to woke standards, is that Elvis was a wimp who stole black music and was manipulated by ""Colonel"" Parker all his life and that old, white people are bad.After the hallucinatory, nausea-inducing intro focussed on Colonel Parker, the first part of the film, with plenty of gospel and black nightclubbing, looks more like an anti-segregation documentary than an Elvis biopic. Nothing wrong with that, if it was on a movie about the influence of gospel and rhythm and blues on rock'n'roll, but this is about Elvis... or is it?The second part of the movie drags on, with compulsory scenes already seen a billion times in every movie about rock'n'roll, about the old, white male establishment being shocked by Elvis and his pelvis and a totally unnecessary repetition of some of the songs already played in the first part. The third act gallantly speeds over Elvis' last years as an ddict and a parody of himself in Vegas.Austin Butler did a great job but that's about it. Everything else feels wrong: the editing is beyond annoying with cuts of 20 seconds and faster, disorienting takes, and gyrating moving shots; Hanks as Parker is unconvincing to say the least but worst of all, the soundtrack is sub-pair, with very few original songs that get repeated during the movie (because Elvis didn't have enough material?) and even polluted by rap, winking to the woke audience.","1 November 2022","6/10",NA

I just wanted to share how good I thought it was. Austin Butler deserves an award for how brilliant he was in this role. I saw where some reviewers were complaining about him not looking closely enough like Elvis but I thought he was a nice fit. There was only one Elvis folks.

"Elvis (2022)","Austin Butler a 10/10 Baz Luhrmann a 7.5 /10","tm-sheehan","My Review Baz Lurhmann's - ElvisMy Rating 7.5 /1010/10 for Austin Butler's portrayal as ElvisElvis has the Baz Lurhmann brand all over it as it's bound to seeing Baz wrote the story as well as Directed and Produced the movie . Whether that's a good thing or not I'm not so sure but top marks for his choice of Austin Butler to play the title role of Elvis Presley.Austin Butler had big shoes to fill and Elvis fans won't be disappointed as he portrays the iconic singer over more than 20 years of his life covering the 50s, 60s, and 70s, eras from his childhood and meteoric rise to stardom to his long, slow decline.This biographical movie unlike the 2019 movie Judy I'm pleased to say covers the good years as well as the sad years when Elvis left us tragically aged only 42 under identical circumstances to Judy Garland who was 47.Both stars burnt out prematurely both were exploited but their fame and legacy of music and film footage will live on for centuries as they are both true historical cultural icons.Austin Butler really does hold the entire movie together for me he gives much more than an Elvis impersonation which so many performers have done before.At times and at certain camera angles Austin Butler looks uncannily identical to Elvis Presley and he sings the early Elvis songbook in his own voice to perfection. Austin's voice is only blended with Elvis's own voice in the later Las Vegas years .Many other actors in addition to Austin Butler auditioned for the role including Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Harry Styles but the right choice to play Elvis certainly was Austin Butler in my opinion.Unlike Rami Malik who played Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody and had the Freddie Mercury teeth he wore cast in gold , Austin Butler's transformation really just relies on eye make up ,hairstyle and the tight pants and flamboyant shirts and capes that Elvis wore during his performances.I'm certain Austin Butler's performance is what prompted the Elvis movie to receive a 12 minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival last month. Rami Malik received an Oscar and lip synched the songs so Austin Butler who sings in his own voice should at least get a Best Actor Oscar nomination in 2023.There were positives I liked in Baz Luhrmann's Elvis and negatives as much as I admire Tom Hanks as an Actor the role of Colonel Tom Parker who is the storyteller through whose eyes we see the rise and fall of The King of Rock is a despicable and ugly character . While of course he is a central character in the Elvis Presley story I felt telling the story through such an unsympathetic character was unnecessary and I found Tom Hanks Dutch accent and his prosthetic nose a little irritating at times.The Cinematography by Mandy Walker is stunning as are the costumes by Baz Luhrmann's 4 time Academy Award winning wife Catherine Martin .All biography movies stretch or modify the facts to a certain extent to add more dramatic content and while this story is reasonably accurate Baz has used some poetic licence in some scenes . The emotional meeting of Elvis and the Producer Steve Binder of his 1968 Christmas comeback show at the iconic rusting L. A. Hollywood sign never happened but it's effective.The opening introduction scene of Colonel Tom Parker discovering Elvis at the Carnival which I'm sure was inspired by Guillermo del Toro's recent movie Nightmare Alley also never occurred. World events of that time are used as a timeline like the assassination of Bobby Kennedy during taping of an Elvis television show also are fiction but it does add drama to the script.There's also a silly hysterical scene where an entire Christmas snow set is built to convince The Colonel that Elvis was going to sing Here Comes Santa Claus in his 1968 comeback show this also apparently was a complete fiction as was the fact that Elvis was persuaded by Parker to enlist in the army rather than being arrested for his suggestive stage gyrations. Elvis did not enlist he was drafted and surrounded by the media when he entered the Army in March 1958.Those who love Showman Baz Luhrmann's flamboyant highly individual directing style I'm sure will love Elvis I enjoyed it but didn't love it.The supporting cast that includes Olivia De Jonge as Pricilla Richard Roxburgh as Vernon Presley Helen Thomson as Gladys and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Jimmie Rodgers Snow are all good but in my view could have been featured more .I personally think he lacks subtlety and while putting on a great show his script in this case focuses to much on the character of Colonel Tom Parker and as I recently referred to heroes as main characters in stories Colonel Tom Parker was no hero. Colonel Tom reminds me more of Rumpelstiltskin in more ways than one Elvis turned the straw that Colonel Tom Parker gave him into gold and like the Princess in the Grimm's Fairy Tale sadly Elvis paid a very high price.","4 July 2022","7/10",NA

The narrative frame comes from the voice of Colonel Parker (Tom Hanks), Presley's manager and quasi-abuser (largely in the financial department). Elvis's relationship to ""black music"", teen heartthrob fame, military service, and late-60s comeback are all given time here, including his marriage to Priscilla (Olivia DeJonge).Perhaps the most notable thing to mention about ""Elvis"" is that the first 30-45 minutes are kind of a mess. Luhrmann is in peak wackadoodle form (granted, what else could be expected from the director of 1996's ""Romeo + Juliet""), what with jarring time-cuts, crazy montages (one that turns the proceedings into a comic book!), and quite a bit of time spent on the bizarre Hanks Parker portrayal. There is also a far-too-on-the-nose scene in which a young Presley supposedly learns his later musical style via an R&B jam session and a revival ministry happening concurrently. I'd blame no one for thinking this was a total mess before the 1 hour mark.Fortunately, in this case, there is still 2 hours left of ""Elvis"", and that's when it settles into being a pretty entertaining film. Basically, once all the crazy material is out of the way and audiences can just settle into Butler's portrayal, there is a lot to like. I was really impressed with Butler's ability to portray the young rebellious Elvis, as well as the fat, worn-down-by-life version. The staged musical numbers are every bit as good as those found in recent musical biopics like Rocketman or Bohemian Rhapsody. I'll certainly be revisiting some Presley tunes after seeing this.Overall, I can't put ""Elvis"" in my top tier (Walk the Line, Love & Mercy, & Judy) of biopics because its director seems almost physically unable to ""tell it straight"" when this film and acting performances would have certainly been good enough for that grounded approach. But it was easily good enough to hold my interest and take me on an interesting journey through the iconic musician's entire career.","22 June 2022","7/10",NA
"Elvis (2022)","Incredibly exciting and a roller coaster of emotions! Incredible performance by Austin Butler","rannynm","What a mess.... nearly incoherent storyline. Over 2.5 hours of film, yet after watching you know Elvis no better. It's simply a bunch scenes strung together, accompanied by music, but little to no plot and a complete lack of interesting dialog. The film feels almost like a bad fever dream, arbitrarily switching from scene to scene with little to no connection. Too much attention is put in Parker/Hanks, when he's not narrating he's the focus of every scene he's in. Thankfully Austin Butler and Olivia DeJonge do everything they can to save the train wreck, they still can only do so much, but both are fantastic with what they were given.

Elvis is one of the most vapid, obnoxious, superficial, headache-inducing movies I've seen in I didn't even know how long. Elvis is so bad that it actually makes Bryan Singer's Bohemian Rhapsody look like a masterpiece. I despise this movie, and I knew that I would which was why I put off watching it for so long.Baz Luhrmann is one of the very few filmmakers that I legitimately loathe. Both Romeo and Juliet and The Great Gadsby were two of the most cringe-inducing films I've ever seen. To say that Luhrmann's movies are all style and no substance would be the understatement of the century. I knew within 10 minutes of watching Elvis that Luhrmann had no genuine intentions of telling an authentic and mature story about Elvis Presley. Instead, he was more focused on making a 2 and a half hour music video that has even less depth and heart than Elvis's Wikipedia page.Baz Luhrmann's directing style is so aggressively annoying that it feels like he's trying to cater this movie to an audience of ADHD-stricken toddlers. The editing in this film felt like it was done by cokeheads. Most shots in this movie lasted less than 5 seconds. I know that because I counted. This movie cannot sit still. On top of that, there is the classic Luhrmann trademark of adding crappy pop and rap music to all of his films which never works and always feels out of place. This movie even went as far as taking Elvis' songs and remixing them with random modern pop artists. The most nauseating example of this was when they remixed Viva Las Vegas with Britney Spears' Toxic. I'm not kidding.This movie feels like a bad joke. All the authenticity that was desperately needed in order for the film to have any sort of emotional impact gets completely wiped out by Luhrmann's overly flashy visual nonsense. I felt nothing watching this movie, even in its most dramatic moments.There were numerous times when this movie went full-on Dewey Cox and didn't even see the irony.

Nothing wrong with that, if it was on a movie about the influence of gospel and rhythm and blues on rock'n'roll, but this is about Elvis... or is it?The second part of the movie drags on, with compulsory scenes already seen a billion times in every movie about rock'n'roll, about the old, white male establishment being shocked by Elvis and his pelvis and a totally unnecessary repetition of some of the songs already played in the first part. The third act gallantly speeds over Elvis' last years as an ddict and a parody of himself in Vegas.Austin Butler did a great job but that's about it. Everything else feels wrong: the editing is beyond annoying with cuts of 20 seconds and faster, disorienting takes, and gyrating moving shots; Hanks as Parker is unconvincing to say the least but worst of all, the soundtrack is sub-pair, with very few original songs that get repeated during the movie (because Elvis didn't have enough material?) and even polluted by rap, winking to the woke audience.","1 November 2022","6/10",NA

I saw where some reviewers were complaining about him not looking closely enough like Elvis but I thought he was a nice fit. There was only one Elvis folks.

"Elvis (2022)","Austin Butler a 10/10 Baz Luhrmann a 7.5 /10","tm-sheehan","My Review Baz Lurhmann's - ElvisMy Rating 7.5 /1010/10 for Austin Butler's portrayal as ElvisElvis has the Baz Lurhmann brand all over it as it's bound to seeing Baz wrote the story as well as Directed and Produced the movie . Whether that's a good thing or not I'm not so sure but top marks for his choice of Austin Butler to play the title role of Elvis Presley.Austin Butler had big shoes to fill and Elvis fans won't be disappointed as he portrays the iconic singer over more than 20 years of his life covering the 50s, 60s, and 70s, eras from his childhood and meteoric rise to stardom to his long, slow decline.This biographical movie unlike the 2019 movie Judy I'm pleased to say covers the good years as well as the sad years when Elvis left us tragically aged only 42 under identical circumstances to Judy Garland who was 47.Both stars burnt out prematurely both were exploited but their fame and legacy of music and film footage will live on for centuries as they are both true historical cultural icons.Austin Butler really does hold the entire movie together for me he gives much more than an Elvis impersonation which so many performers have done before.At times and at certain camera angles Austin Butler looks uncannily identical to Elvis Presley and he sings the early Elvis songbook in his own voice to perfection. Austin's voice is only blended with Elvis's own voice in the later Las Vegas years .Many other actors in addition to Austin Butler auditioned for the role including Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Harry Styles but the right choice to play Elvis certainly was Austin Butler in my opinion.Unlike Rami Malik who played Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody and had the Freddie Mercury teeth he wore cast in gold , Austin Butler's transformation really just relies on eye make up ,hairstyle and the tight pants and flamboyant shirts and capes that Elvis wore during his performances.I'm certain Austin Butler's performance is what prompted the Elvis movie to receive a 12 minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival last month. Rami Malik received an Oscar and lip synched the songs so Austin Butler who sings in his own voice should at least get a Best Actor Oscar nomination in 2023.There were positives I liked in Baz Luhrmann's Elvis and negatives as much as I admire Tom Hanks as an Actor the role of Colonel Tom Parker who is the storyteller through whose eyes we see the rise and fall of The King of Rock is a despicable and ugly character . While of course he is a central character in the Elvis Presley story I felt telling the story through such an unsympathetic character was unnecessary and I found Tom Hanks Dutch accent and his prosthetic nose a little irritating at times.The Cinematography by Mandy Walker is stunning as are the costumes by Baz Luhrmann's 4 time Academy Award winning wife Catherine Martin .All biography movies stretch or modify the facts to a certain extent to add more dramatic content and while this story is reasonably accurate Baz has used some poetic licence in some scenes . The emotional meeting of Elvis and the Producer Steve Binder of his 1968 Christmas comeback show at the iconic rusting L. A. Hollywood sign never happened but it's effective.The opening introduction scene of Colonel Tom Parker discovering Elvis at the Carnival which I'm sure was inspired by Guillermo del Toro's recent movie Nightmare Alley also never occurred. World events of that time are used as a timeline like the assassination of Bobby Kennedy during taping of an Elvis television show also are fiction but it does add drama to the script.There's also a silly hysterical scene where an entire Christmas snow set is built to convince The Colonel that Elvis was going to sing Here Comes Santa Claus in his 1968 comeback show this also apparently was a complete fiction as was the fact that Elvis was persuaded by Parker to enlist in the army rather than being arrested for his suggestive stage gyrations. Elvis did not enlist he was drafted and surrounded by the media when he entered the Army in March 1958.Those who love Showman Baz Luhrmann's flamboyant highly individual directing style I'm sure will love Elvis I enjoyed it but didn't love it.The supporting cast that includes Olivia De Jonge as Pricilla Richard Roxburgh as Vernon Presley Helen Thomson as Gladys and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Jimmie Rodgers Snow are all good but in my view could have been featured more .I personally think he lacks subtlety and while putting on a great show his script in this case focuses to much on the character of Colonel Tom Parker and as I recently referred to heroes as main characters in stories Colonel Tom Parker was no hero. Colonel Tom reminds me more of Rumpelstiltskin in more ways than one Elvis turned the straw that Colonel Tom Parker gave him into gold and like the Princess in the Grimm's Fairy Tale sadly Elvis paid a very high price.","4 July 2022","7/10",NA

"  The Dig (2021)","Phenomenal performances from Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes","yusufpiskin","There are so many really good things about this movie, such a great piece of story telling.
The cast is excellent and all put in great performances, especially Lily James and Ralph Fiennes.
It's not just about an archaeological dig though, it's about past lives, present lives and how things are remembered in the future.
There are also several strands to the relationships between all invloved too, including working relationships, family relationships, class and secret relationships.
I don't know how much of the story is fiction or fact but it is well told either way. All this set with a backdrop of the coming second world war.
I am lucky enough to have seen the Sutton Hoo treasures at the British Museum and have always been keenly interested in archeology so this film based on the true story of this discovery was right up my street.","30 January 2021","9/10",NA
"  The Dig (2021)","An enthralling slow-burner that uses patient, understated character drama to fantastic effect","themadmovieman","An intriguing little piece of British history, The Dig tells a slow-burning story with understated and genuine drama throughout, turning what could have been a rather dry tale of archaeology into a genuinely gripping character drama. Its historical context takes a little while to become fully relevant, but ultimately, The Dig really proves itself as a captivating watch.One of the things that I really liked about The Dig was its patience. Never dragging yet never rushing, the film takes its time to build up all of its main strengths, from its characters, their emotional back stories, and the overarching historical context of the outbreak of World War II.Complete with elegant camerawork, a beautiful score and impressively atmospheric direction that makes it an eye-catching watch from the first few moments, The Dig has enough confidence and depth to keep you engrossed even if its story isn't advancing apace, something that's a lot harder to pull off than you may think.One of the big reasons that the film's patient pacing and style work so well is because of its understated, genuine drama. With calm yet fully convincing performances across the board, particularly from Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan, this isn't a showy period drama by any means, but eases you into a story about real people, making them the centre of attention far more than the historical significance of the event.I'm not particularly well-versed in archaeology, and I didn't know about this discovery before watching this film. I think that might be the case for many other people, but the great thing about The Dig is that it's primarily a character-driven drama, and one that uses emotional intrigue to bring you closer to the story at hand and allow you to appreciate its importance.One element where the film does seem to falter is in its use of the historical backdrop of the lead-up to World War II. Set in the summer months of 1939 before the outbreak of war, there are sporadic references to the coming conflict through the first two acts of the movie, but they don't seem to bear much relevance to this story about an archaeological find.However, the film slowly begins to unveil how the historical context plays into its characters' personal lives and the fate of the dig itself, with dramatic focus shifting significantly in the final act, but just at the right point that the sudden arrival of the war into everyday life feels just like what it would have been like to experience it first-hand, taking over everything seemingly normal in an instant.As a result, while the historical backdrop seems almost contrived at first, it really comes good as the film progresses, another demonstration of how the patience of The Dig really plays into its hands throughout.","29 January 2021","8/10",NA
"  The Dig (2021)","A well written, acted and directed story","robertasmith","So rare to watch a wonderfully gentle but poignant film. It tugs at the emotions as it tells a largely true. Some liberties are taken with the truth but largely accurate. The real story of Peggy Piggott is fascinating and worth a film in itself. However the real stars of the story are Edith Pretty and Basil Brown portrayed brilliantly by Mulligan and Fiennes. One small criticism is that Carey Mulligan is too young for the part but she carries it off superbly and the performance by Ralph Fiennes is one of the best I have seen in a long time. The whole cast is superb and the backdrop of imminent war is ever present throughout the film. I have visited Sutton Hoo a number of times and studied the excavation and I still marvel at the work Basil Brown did. As an archaeologist myself I can say his work even by today's standards was of the highest order. Many of the academic archaeologists before and after WW2 were useless when it came to excavation and recording it. Basil Brown did everything right and it is fantastic he is at last getting the credit he deserved and that Edith Pretty wanted for him. It is to the great shame of the academic establishment it has taken so long. The film portrays this extremely well.","29 January 2021","8/10",NA
"  The Dig (2021)","""and the 2021 OSCAR SNUB AWARD goes to...""","Instant_Palmer","'The Dig' is a beautifully photographed period film (circa 1939, Suffolk, Great Britain) that seemed a lock to garner first Oscars for Ralph Fiennes (*overdue) and Cinematographer Mike Eley. Therefore, I'm instituting the 1st Annual ""Oscar Snub Award"" to the film most undeservedly left out of nominations. This year it was a no brainer - 'The Dig' wins and it wasn't close. So on with my original review B. S. (""Before Snub"")...Metaphors supporting Themes abound in 'The Dig' - ""life is fleeting"", ""the search for meaning in our lives"", ""our relevance in History"", and ""is this all there is"". Classic themes for dramas that are the eternal questions within our lives. The film intertwines those themes within the central characters, each conducting their own search for answers.The framework of the story occurs on the eve of WWII for Great Britain. The impending gravity of such hovers over the film, intensifying the characters' emotions and urgency in searching for answers to such questions - the telescope and magnifying glass used within the story serve as metaphors to that end.

There are many more such examples in 'The Dig'.Such poetic filmmaking takes painstaking attention to detail in production to pull off at the level achieved in this film. Utilizing the beautiful cinematography of Mike Eley and deft touch of Film Editor Jon Harris, Director Simon Stone succeeds in elevating the The Dig to an elite level of film art.This is without question the Best Picture of the Year, and I am thankful this beautiful film came in at the last possible minute to save an otherwise (and understandable) blah year in the film industry.Director Simon Stone's Oscar nomination for both Director and Best Picture is a virtual certainty.Ralph Fiennes (Basil Brown) never misses (except taking home an Oscar), but I predict he will FINALLY* be recognized by Academy members en masse for his best of the year acting in this film, along with Mike Eley for Cinematography.Carey Mulligan (Edith Pretty) should be nominated except she has two Oscar worthy films, both with a deserved good chance to take home an Oscar. Her spotlight lead part in 'A Promising Young Woman' has much more Oscar potential which will negate her role in The Dig - Mulligan should get Actress of the Year for putting forth two such great performances in one year!At the end of the night (Oscar night), 'The Dig' could sweep up wins in the aforementioned major Oscar categories for 2020 - I certainly wouldn't bet against it happening (EDIT: Boy was I wrong 😑), and In terms of total Oscar nominations, this film sets up as the front contender for 2020. Then again, it could be a dodgy awards year - competition of last minute entries (is it going to get to the point where releases occur the day before the voting deadline?), and above-the-norm ""agendas"" abound in the industry these days [EDIT: Boy, was I correct about this (I am sorry to say)].While the ensemble cast is highly competent, I don't see a particular supporting role having enough ""spotlight momentum"" to break-out and win an Oscar, although Lily James (Peggy Piggott) is a long-shot.If there was one weak point in the film, it would be the digression to the character Peggy that seems to be thinly integrated into the film. This hole in the film likely comes from Editing decisions, and will probably cost Lily James, Jon Harris (Editing), and Stone and co-writer Moira Buffini (Adapted Screenplay) Oscar nominations.The film runs under 2 hours, and it would have only required adding another 5-10 minutes to fully integrate Peggy into the story - Peggy is at a crossroads in her young life and her marriage to a man not interested in women forecasts a gloomy future - She gets sage advice from Edith Pretty (Mulligan) on seizing the day (and not to make the same mistakes she made).My advice to Stone is ""Don't start something without completing it"". My guess is there is extra footage on Peggy and perhaps a Director's-Cut extended version will be released at some point completing Peggy's story - I'd like to see that.👍👍 to all involved in 'The Dig' - the film is a treat for the eyes - the acting superior - production execution excellent - it is 2020's Best Picture by classic film making standards, despite being the biggest Oscar snub of the 2021 Academy Awards.Here's hoping ""agendas"" and politics are left out of recognizing the best in film arts. (EDIT: Clearly agendas were NOT left out based on nominations MIA🙁)* Ralph Fiennes sits atop my IMDb list of 'Best Actors Without An Oscar' (EDIT: and will continue to be atop the list for at least one more year - Note: At least Glen Close has a shot at graduating off my no-Oscar list 🤞)","30 January 2021","9/10",NA

Films on subjects like this can be either dry or trivial or triumphalist or worthy or just bad.But from the first scenes this film is beautiful. These is no other word. The outdoor scenes (and much of it is outdoors) is just breathtakingly gorgeous at times. This is Suffolk and wow does it look good. If anyone has seen the BBC series ""The Detectorists"" they will get the idea. It captures the big skies of East Anglia so well, sun through the early morning mists, or even after the rain like works of art. The stage on which the action is set is sumptuous.As for the action - its just so good. Almost dreamlike at times - I found myself thinking of ""The Go-Between"" (also set in Suffolk, of course!) with dialogue over the top of action that is not taking place at quite the same time. Hard to describe, but its like memories.Some of the film is a shade predictable - the small enthusiast verses the big guy, the mismatched couple and a possible tragic love story, the child's eye view at times, the repressed sexuality of the period - it's all there.

"  The Dig (2021)","Watch it for the wonderful performances from Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes","paul-allaer","""The Dig"" (2021 release from the UK; 112 min.) reminds us at the very beginning that this is ""Based On a True Story"". We then go to ""Suffolk, England, 1939"" as Basil Brown arrives at the house of Edith Pretty. Turns out Mrs. Pretty has hired Mr. Brown to do some archeological work on her estate. Her young son excitedly asks Mr. Brown ""Are you going to dig upo the mountain?"". Mr. Brown, taking room and pension at Mrs. Ptretty's house, starts to dig and soon is working his way towards some intriguing finds... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is directed by little known Australian director Simon Stone (""The Daughter)"". Here he brings us a historical drama about what later became known as the Sutton Hoo treasure, one of the biggest archeological finds in British history. The setting of 1939 is pivotal in several ways: of course the threat of WWII is in the air, but even more important, the way of life in those days was just entirely different, and being in a remote English area (near Ipswich) only reinfornces that. So be prepated for a slow moving film, I didn't mind it one bit. Even more critical for the movie is Carey Mulligan's exquisite lead performance. Playing a person who is more than 20 years her senior in real life (Carey is 35, Mrs, Pretty was in her mid-50s in 1939), she does so with grace and style and presence. The role couldn't be more different from what Carey did in the recently released ""Promising Young Woman"", which was in my top 3 of the bests films of 2020. Ralph Fiennes is equally great as the excavator Mr. Brown. Last but not least there is a wonderful orchestral score by Stefan Gregory, who I must admit was previously unknown to me.""The Dig"" opened last weekend in select theaters for a short run before then moving on to Netflix. (Seems like every other new theatrical release these days follows that pattern....) Thankfully the film opened at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early Satruday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (exactly 5 people including myself). Never mind. If you are in the mood for a good ol' fashioned hisstorical drama featuring outstanding performances from Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD< or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","10 February 2021","7/10",NA

The cast is excellent and all put in great performances, especially Lily James and Ralph Fiennes.
It's not just about an archaeological dig though, it's about past lives, present lives and how things are remembered in the future.
There are also several strands to the relationships between all invloved too, including working relationships, family relationships, class and secret relationships.
I don't know how much of the story is fiction or fact but it is well told either way. All this set with a backdrop of the coming second world war.

"  The Dig (2021)","An enthralling slow-burner that uses patient, understated character drama to fantastic effect","themadmovieman","An intriguing little piece of British history, The Dig tells a slow-burning story with understated and genuine drama throughout, turning what could have been a rather dry tale of archaeology into a genuinely gripping character drama. Its historical context takes a little while to become fully relevant, but ultimately, The Dig really proves itself as a captivating watch.One of the things that I really liked about The Dig was its patience. Never dragging yet never rushing, the film takes its time to build up all of its main strengths, from its characters, their emotional back stories, and the overarching historical context of the outbreak of World War II.Complete with elegant camerawork, a beautiful score and impressively atmospheric direction that makes it an eye-catching watch from the first few moments, The Dig has enough confidence and depth to keep you engrossed even if its story isn't advancing apace, something that's a lot harder to pull off than you may think.One of the big reasons that the film's patient pacing and style work so well is because of its understated, genuine drama. With calm yet fully convincing performances across the board, particularly from Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan, this isn't a showy period drama by any means, but eases you into a story about real people, making them the centre of attention far more than the historical significance of the event.I'm not particularly well-versed in archaeology, and I didn't know about this discovery before watching this film. I think that might be the case for many other people, but the great thing about The Dig is that it's primarily a character-driven drama, and one that uses emotional intrigue to bring you closer to the story at hand and allow you to appreciate its importance.One element where the film does seem to falter is in its use of the historical backdrop of the lead-up to World War II. Set in the summer months of 1939 before the outbreak of war, there are sporadic references to the coming conflict through the first two acts of the movie, but they don't seem to bear much relevance to this story about an archaeological find.However, the film slowly begins to unveil how the historical context plays into its characters' personal lives and the fate of the dig itself, with dramatic focus shifting significantly in the final act, but just at the right point that the sudden arrival of the war into everyday life feels just like what it would have been like to experience it first-hand, taking over everything seemingly normal in an instant.As a result, while the historical backdrop seems almost contrived at first, it really comes good as the film progresses, another demonstration of how the patience of The Dig really plays into its hands throughout.","29 January 2021","8/10",NA
"  The Dig (2021)","A well written, acted and directed story","robertasmith","So rare to watch a wonderfully gentle but poignant film. It tugs at the emotions as it tells a largely true. Some liberties are taken with the truth but largely accurate. The real story of Peggy Piggott is fascinating and worth a film in itself. However the real stars of the story are Edith Pretty and Basil Brown portrayed brilliantly by Mulligan and Fiennes. One small criticism is that Carey Mulligan is too young for the part but she carries it off superbly and the performance by Ralph Fiennes is one of the best I have seen in a long time. The whole cast is superb and the backdrop of imminent war is ever present throughout the film. I have visited Sutton Hoo a number of times and studied the excavation and I still marvel at the work Basil Brown did. As an archaeologist myself I can say his work even by today's standards was of the highest order. Many of the academic archaeologists before and after WW2 were useless when it came to excavation and recording it. Basil Brown did everything right and it is fantastic he is at last getting the credit he deserved and that Edith Pretty wanted for him. It is to the great shame of the academic establishment it has taken so long. The film portrays this extremely well.","29 January 2021","8/10",NA

Utilizing the beautiful cinematography of Mike Eley and deft touch of Film Editor Jon Harris, Director Simon Stone succeeds in elevating the The Dig to an elite level of film art.This is without question the Best Picture of the Year, and I am thankful this beautiful film came in at the last possible minute to save an otherwise (and understandable) blah year in the film industry.Director Simon Stone's Oscar nomination for both Director and Best Picture is a virtual certainty.Ralph Fiennes (Basil Brown) never misses (except taking home an Oscar), but I predict he will FINALLY* be recognized by Academy members en masse for his best of the year acting in this film, along with Mike Eley for Cinematography.Carey Mulligan (Edith Pretty) should be nominated except she has two Oscar worthy films, both with a deserved good chance to take home an Oscar. Her spotlight lead part in 'A Promising Young Woman' has much more Oscar potential which will negate her role in The Dig - Mulligan should get Actress of the Year for putting forth two such great performances in one year!At the end of the night (Oscar night), 'The Dig' could sweep up wins in the aforementioned major Oscar categories for 2020 - I certainly wouldn't bet against it happening (EDIT: Boy was I wrong 😑), and In terms of total Oscar nominations, this film sets up as the front contender for 2020. Then again, it could be a dodgy awards year - competition of last minute entries (is it going to get to the point where releases occur the day before the voting deadline?), and above-the-norm ""agendas"" abound in the industry these days [EDIT: Boy, was I correct about this (I am sorry to say)].While the ensemble cast is highly competent, I don't see a particular supporting role having enough ""spotlight momentum"" to break-out and win an Oscar, although Lily James (Peggy Piggott) is a long-shot.If there was one weak point in the film, it would be the digression to the character Peggy that seems to be thinly integrated into the film. This hole in the film likely comes from Editing decisions, and will probably cost Lily James, Jon Harris (Editing), and Stone and co-writer Moira Buffini (Adapted Screenplay) Oscar nominations.The film runs under 2 hours, and it would have only required adding another 5-10 minutes to fully integrate Peggy into the story - Peggy is at a crossroads in her young life and her marriage to a man not interested in women forecasts a gloomy future - She gets sage advice from Edith Pretty (Mulligan) on seizing the day (and not to make the same mistakes she made).My advice to Stone is ""Don't start something without completing it"". My guess is there is extra footage on Peggy and perhaps a Director's-Cut extended version will be released at some point completing Peggy's story - I'd like to see that.👍👍 to all involved in 'The Dig' - the film is a treat for the eyes - the acting superior - production execution excellent - it is 2020's Best Picture by classic film making standards, despite being the biggest Oscar snub of the 2021 Academy Awards.Here's hoping ""agendas"" and politics are left out of recognizing the best in film arts. (EDIT: Clearly agendas were NOT left out based on nominations MIA🙁)* Ralph Fiennes sits atop my IMDb list of 'Best Actors Without An Oscar' (EDIT: and will continue to be atop the list for at least one more year - Note: At least Glen Close has a shot at graduating off my no-Oscar list 🤞)","30 January 2021","9/10",NA

Films on subjects like this can be either dry or trivial or triumphalist or worthy or just bad.But from the first scenes this film is beautiful. These is no other word. The outdoor scenes (and much of it is outdoors) is just breathtakingly gorgeous at times. This is Suffolk and wow does it look good. If anyone has seen the BBC series ""The Detectorists"" they will get the idea. It captures the big skies of East Anglia so well, sun through the early morning mists, or even after the rain like works of art. The stage on which the action is set is sumptuous.As for the action - its just so good. Almost dreamlike at times - I found myself thinking of ""The Go-Between"" (also set in Suffolk, of course!) with dialogue over the top of action that is not taking place at quite the same time. Hard to describe, but its like memories.Some of the film is a shade predictable - the small enthusiast verses the big guy, the mismatched couple and a possible tragic love story, the child's eye view at times, the repressed sexuality of the period - it's all there.

"  The Dig (2021)","Watch it for the wonderful performances from Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes","paul-allaer","""The Dig"" (2021 release from the UK; 112 min.) reminds us at the very beginning that this is ""Based On a True Story"". We then go to ""Suffolk, England, 1939"" as Basil Brown arrives at the house of Edith Pretty. Turns out Mrs. Pretty has hired Mr. Brown to do some archeological work on her estate. Her young son excitedly asks Mr. Brown ""Are you going to dig upo the mountain?"". Mr. Brown, taking room and pension at Mrs. Ptretty's house, starts to dig and soon is working his way towards some intriguing finds... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is directed by little known Australian director Simon Stone (""The Daughter)"". Here he brings us a historical drama about what later became known as the Sutton Hoo treasure, one of the biggest archeological finds in British history. The setting of 1939 is pivotal in several ways: of course the threat of WWII is in the air, but even more important, the way of life in those days was just entirely different, and being in a remote English area (near Ipswich) only reinfornces that. So be prepated for a slow moving film, I didn't mind it one bit. Even more critical for the movie is Carey Mulligan's exquisite lead performance. Playing a person who is more than 20 years her senior in real life (Carey is 35, Mrs, Pretty was in her mid-50s in 1939), she does so with grace and style and presence. The role couldn't be more different from what Carey did in the recently released ""Promising Young Woman"", which was in my top 3 of the bests films of 2020. Ralph Fiennes is equally great as the excavator Mr. Brown. Last but not least there is a wonderful orchestral score by Stefan Gregory, who I must admit was previously unknown to me.""The Dig"" opened last weekend in select theaters for a short run before then moving on to Netflix. (Seems like every other new theatrical release these days follows that pattern....) Thankfully the film opened at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early Satruday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (exactly 5 people including myself). Never mind. If you are in the mood for a good ol' fashioned hisstorical drama featuring outstanding performances from Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD< or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","10 February 2021","7/10",NA

The cast is excellent and all put in great performances, especially Lily James and Ralph Fiennes.
It's not just about an archaeological dig though, it's about past lives, present lives and how things are remembered in the future.
There are also several strands to the relationships between all invloved too, including working relationships, family relationships, class and secret relationships.
I don't know how much of the story is fiction or fact but it is well told either way. All this set with a backdrop of the coming second world war.

"  The Dig (2021)","An enthralling slow-burner that uses patient, understated character drama to fantastic effect","themadmovieman","An intriguing little piece of British history, The Dig tells a slow-burning story with understated and genuine drama throughout, turning what could have been a rather dry tale of archaeology into a genuinely gripping character drama. Its historical context takes a little while to become fully relevant, but ultimately, The Dig really proves itself as a captivating watch.One of the things that I really liked about The Dig was its patience. Never dragging yet never rushing, the film takes its time to build up all of its main strengths, from its characters, their emotional back stories, and the overarching historical context of the outbreak of World War II.Complete with elegant camerawork, a beautiful score and impressively atmospheric direction that makes it an eye-catching watch from the first few moments, The Dig has enough confidence and depth to keep you engrossed even if its story isn't advancing apace, something that's a lot harder to pull off than you may think.One of the big reasons that the film's patient pacing and style work so well is because of its understated, genuine drama. With calm yet fully convincing performances across the board, particularly from Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan, this isn't a showy period drama by any means, but eases you into a story about real people, making them the centre of attention far more than the historical significance of the event.I'm not particularly well-versed in archaeology, and I didn't know about this discovery before watching this film. I think that might be the case for many other people, but the great thing about The Dig is that it's primarily a character-driven drama, and one that uses emotional intrigue to bring you closer to the story at hand and allow you to appreciate its importance.One element where the film does seem to falter is in its use of the historical backdrop of the lead-up to World War II. Set in the summer months of 1939 before the outbreak of war, there are sporadic references to the coming conflict through the first two acts of the movie, but they don't seem to bear much relevance to this story about an archaeological find.However, the film slowly begins to unveil how the historical context plays into its characters' personal lives and the fate of the dig itself, with dramatic focus shifting significantly in the final act, but just at the right point that the sudden arrival of the war into everyday life feels just like what it would have been like to experience it first-hand, taking over everything seemingly normal in an instant.As a result, while the historical backdrop seems almost contrived at first, it really comes good as the film progresses, another demonstration of how the patience of The Dig really plays into its hands throughout.","29 January 2021","8/10",NA
"  The Dig (2021)","A well written, acted and directed story","robertasmith","So rare to watch a wonderfully gentle but poignant film. It tugs at the emotions as it tells a largely true. Some liberties are taken with the truth but largely accurate. The real story of Peggy Piggott is fascinating and worth a film in itself. However the real stars of the story are Edith Pretty and Basil Brown portrayed brilliantly by Mulligan and Fiennes. One small criticism is that Carey Mulligan is too young for the part but she carries it off superbly and the performance by Ralph Fiennes is one of the best I have seen in a long time. The whole cast is superb and the backdrop of imminent war is ever present throughout the film. I have visited Sutton Hoo a number of times and studied the excavation and I still marvel at the work Basil Brown did. As an archaeologist myself I can say his work even by today's standards was of the highest order. Many of the academic archaeologists before and after WW2 were useless when it came to excavation and recording it. Basil Brown did everything right and it is fantastic he is at last getting the credit he deserved and that Edith Pretty wanted for him. It is to the great shame of the academic establishment it has taken so long. The film portrays this extremely well.","29 January 2021","8/10",NA

Utilizing the beautiful cinematography of Mike Eley and deft touch of Film Editor Jon Harris, Director Simon Stone succeeds in elevating the The Dig to an elite level of film art.This is without question the Best Picture of the Year, and I am thankful this beautiful film came in at the last possible minute to save an otherwise (and understandable) blah year in the film industry.Director Simon Stone's Oscar nomination for both Director and Best Picture is a virtual certainty.Ralph Fiennes (Basil Brown) never misses (except taking home an Oscar), but I predict he will FINALLY* be recognized by Academy members en masse for his best of the year acting in this film, along with Mike Eley for Cinematography.Carey Mulligan (Edith Pretty) should be nominated except she has two Oscar worthy films, both with a deserved good chance to take home an Oscar. Her spotlight lead part in 'A Promising Young Woman' has much more Oscar potential which will negate her role in The Dig - Mulligan should get Actress of the Year for putting forth two such great performances in one year!At the end of the night (Oscar night), 'The Dig' could sweep up wins in the aforementioned major Oscar categories for 2020 - I certainly wouldn't bet against it happening (EDIT: Boy was I wrong 😑), and In terms of total Oscar nominations, this film sets up as the front contender for 2020. Then again, it could be a dodgy awards year - competition of last minute entries (is it going to get to the point where releases occur the day before the voting deadline?), and above-the-norm ""agendas"" abound in the industry these days [EDIT: Boy, was I correct about this (I am sorry to say)].While the ensemble cast is highly competent, I don't see a particular supporting role having enough ""spotlight momentum"" to break-out and win an Oscar, although Lily James (Peggy Piggott) is a long-shot.If there was one weak point in the film, it would be the digression to the character Peggy that seems to be thinly integrated into the film. This hole in the film likely comes from Editing decisions, and will probably cost Lily James, Jon Harris (Editing), and Stone and co-writer Moira Buffini (Adapted Screenplay) Oscar nominations.The film runs under 2 hours, and it would have only required adding another 5-10 minutes to fully integrate Peggy into the story - Peggy is at a crossroads in her young life and her marriage to a man not interested in women forecasts a gloomy future - She gets sage advice from Edith Pretty (Mulligan) on seizing the day (and not to make the same mistakes she made).My advice to Stone is ""Don't start something without completing it"". My guess is there is extra footage on Peggy and perhaps a Director's-Cut extended version will be released at some point completing Peggy's story - I'd like to see that.👍👍 to all involved in 'The Dig' - the film is a treat for the eyes - the acting superior - production execution excellent - it is 2020's Best Picture by classic film making standards, despite being the biggest Oscar snub of the 2021 Academy Awards.Here's hoping ""agendas"" and politics are left out of recognizing the best in film arts. (EDIT: Clearly agendas were NOT left out based on nominations MIA🙁)* Ralph Fiennes sits atop my IMDb list of 'Best Actors Without An Oscar' (EDIT: and will continue to be atop the list for at least one more year - Note: At least Glen Close has a shot at graduating off my no-Oscar list 🤞)","30 January 2021","9/10",NA
"  The Dig (2021)","First-rate performances and a gem of a film","anisen-undefined","Honestly, I landed on the film last night, browsing titles on Netflix, because of Lily James - having known nothing else about the film from before (I usually skip trailers these days), but that she was in the cast was a huge draw for me - and found immense pleasure in this gem of a film. From Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes to Ben Chaplin and Archie Barnes, the performances are all first-rate. The real-life story is told with great finesse, and filmed earnestly with a keen eye for production details. I have to say, even some of the lesser moments from the film shall stay with me for long, its appeal is that strong.","11 March 2021","8/10",NA
"  The Dig (2021)","Refreshing sadness....","searchanddestroy-1","What a beautiful, moving story and film, and acting....I was stunned by this feature, and I realized that it was real good for mental health to discover such gems from time to time. That's unfortunately not the kind of film that audiences in theaters will come to see, at least not the bulk audiences. There is not real love interest here, not as in other films, I mean. This is a so sensitive and poignant story, so unexpected story telling. Thanks Netflix for having released this movie.","29 January 2021","9/10",NA
"  The Dig (2021)","Beautiful film that took me by surprise it is so good","johnbirch-2","This is a superb film that I could watch again and again.I've been to see the Sutton Hoo treasures many times and have seen the story told on TV from Blue Peter to Horizon so I was looking forward to this... but also slightly worried about it. Films on subjects like this can be either dry or trivial or triumphalist or worthy or just bad.But from the first scenes this film is beautiful. These is no other word. The outdoor scenes (and much of it is outdoors) is just breathtakingly gorgeous at times. This is Suffolk and wow does it look good. If anyone has seen the BBC series ""The Detectorists"" they will get the idea. It captures the big skies of East Anglia so well, sun through the early morning mists, or even after the rain like works of art. The stage on which the action is set is sumptuous.As for the action - its just so good. Almost dreamlike at times - I found myself thinking of ""The Go-Between"" (also set in Suffolk, of course!) with dialogue over the top of action that is not taking place at quite the same time. Hard to describe, but its like memories.Some of the film is a shade predictable - the small enthusiast verses the big guy, the mismatched couple and a possible tragic love story, the child's eye view at times, the repressed sexuality of the period - it's all there. But it is so well done.The only downside is that this film - this photography - deserves the big screen, but most people will now see it on the small. This is such a shame. Its deserved so much more.","29 January 2021","10/10",NA
"  The Dig (2021)","A Real Story","ceyda1811","There is a lot I can say about this film, but I'll keep it short.
If you love simple stories being told in a beautiful and clear manner, and if you like Archaeology, then this is the film for you. All of the actors have done a wonderful job.","20 January 2021","8/10",NA
"  The Dig (2021)","Watch it for the wonderful performances from Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes","paul-allaer","""The Dig"" (2021 release from the UK; 112 min.) reminds us at the very beginning that this is ""Based On a True Story"". We then go to ""Suffolk, England, 1939"" as Basil Brown arrives at the house of Edith Pretty. Turns out Mrs. Pretty has hired Mr. Brown to do some archeological work on her estate. Her young son excitedly asks Mr. Brown ""Are you going to dig upo the mountain?"". Mr. Brown, taking room and pension at Mrs. Ptretty's house, starts to dig and soon is working his way towards some intriguing finds... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is directed by little known Australian director Simon Stone (""The Daughter)"". Here he brings us a historical drama about what later became known as the Sutton Hoo treasure, one of the biggest archeological finds in British history. The setting of 1939 is pivotal in several ways: of course the threat of WWII is in the air, but even more important, the way of life in those days was just entirely different, and being in a remote English area (near Ipswich) only reinfornces that. So be prepated for a slow moving film, I didn't mind it one bit. Even more critical for the movie is Carey Mulligan's exquisite lead performance. Playing a person who is more than 20 years her senior in real life (Carey is 35, Mrs, Pretty was in her mid-50s in 1939), she does so with grace and style and presence. The role couldn't be more different from what Carey did in the recently released ""Promising Young Woman"", which was in my top 3 of the bests films of 2020. Ralph Fiennes is equally great as the excavator Mr. Brown. Last but not least there is a wonderful orchestral score by Stefan Gregory, who I must admit was previously unknown to me.""The Dig"" opened last weekend in select theaters for a short run before then moving on to Netflix. (Seems like every other new theatrical release these days follows that pattern....) Thankfully the film opened at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early Satruday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (exactly 5 people including myself). Never mind. If you are in the mood for a good ol' fashioned hisstorical drama featuring outstanding performances from Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD< or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","10 February 2021","7/10",NA
"  The Dig (2021)","I wonder what England used to be like","lee_eisenberg","What a fascinating, unusual film this was. The story is different, but totally captivating.A film that can truly be loved by the whole family, themes that are a suitable for all, with a story and series of events I can imagine many enjoying.It is fascinating that the events of this film coincide with the start of the second world war. It doesn't focus massively on the undertones of WWII, but it simmers in the background until the latter part of the film.It looks exquisite, the production values are fabulous, and best of all, the acting. Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes are both superb, many other top notch performances elsewhere, always great to see Ken Stott.It's not the usual kind of film I go for, but I was won over in minutes, this is an exceptional film.Loved it, 9/10.","5 February 2021","9/10",NA
