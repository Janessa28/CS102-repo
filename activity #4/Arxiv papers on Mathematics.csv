"1","Packing the largest trees in the tree packing conjecture","Barnabás Janzer, Richard Montgomery","Combinatorics (math.CO)","The famous tree packing conjecture of Gyárfás from 1976 says that any sequence of trees $T_1,\ldots,T_n$ such that $|T_i|=i$ for each $i\in [n]$ packs into the complete $n$-vertex graph $K_n$. Packing even just the largest trees in such a sequence has proven difficult, with Bollobás drawing attention to this in 1995 by conjecturing that, for each $k$, if $n$ is sufficiently large then the largest $k$ trees in any such sequence can be packed into $K_n$. This has only been shown for $k\leq 5$, by Żak, despite many partial results and much related work on the full tree packing conjecture. We prove Bollobás's conjecture, by showing that, moreover, a linear number of the largest trees can be packed in the tree packing conjecture.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 17:55:03 UTC (51 KB)"
"2","On the frame property of Hermite functions and analytic extensions of their frame sets","Markus Faulhuber, Irina Shafkulovska, Ilya Zlotnikov","Functional Analysis (math.FA)","We study Gabor frames with Hermite window functions. Gröchenig and Lyubarskii provided a sufficient density condition for their frame sets, which leads to what we call the ``safety region"". For rectangular lattices and Hermite windows of order 4 and higher, we enlarge this safety region by providing new points on the boundary of this region. For this purpose, we employ the Janssen representation of the frame operator to compare its distance to the identity in the operator norm. The calculations lead to estimates on series involving Laguerre polynomials with Gaussian weight functions.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 17:43:32 UTC (591 KB)"

As a result the set of all triples of integers is decomposed in classes of equivalence organized in four towers of two-dimensional triangulations. We provide the full characterization of the represented integers belonging to each network as families of certain quadratic forms. We note that one of the towers is generated by a germ that produces a covering of the plane with {Löschian} numbers.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 17:35:02 UTC (9,051 KB)"
"4","Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Safety Verification Using Barrier Certificates and Conditional Mean Embeddings","Oliver Schön, Zhengang Zhong, Sadegh Soudjani","Systems and Control (eess.SY)","Algorithmic verification of realistic systems to satisfy safety and other temporal requirements has suffered from poor scalability of the employed formal approaches. To design systems with rigorous guarantees, many approaches still rely on exact models of the underlying systems. Since this assumption can rarely be met in practice, models have to be inferred from measurement data or are bypassed completely. Whilst former usually requires the model structure to be known a-priori and immense amounts of data to be available, latter gives rise to a plethora of restrictive mathematical assumptions about the unknown dynamics. In a pursuit of developing scalable formal verification algorithms without shifting the problem to unrealistic assumptions, we employ the concept of barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a compact set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result w.r.t. a set of plausible transition kernels. We show how to solve the resulting program efficiently using sum-of-squares optimization and a Gaussian process envelope. Our approach lifts the need for restrictive assumptions on the system dynamics and uncertainty, and suggests an improvement in the sample complexity of verifying the safety of a system on a tested case study compared to a state-of-the-art approach.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 17:32:02 UTC (1,008 KB)"
"5","The inhomogeneous $t$-PushTASEP and Macdonald polynomials","Arvind Ayyer, James Martin, Lauren Williams","Combinatorics (math.CO)","We study a multispecies $t$-PushTASEP system on a finite ring of $n$ sites with site-dependent rates $x_1,\dots,x_n$. Let $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n)$ be a partition whose parts represent the species of the $n$ particles on the ring. We show that for each composition $\eta$ obtained by permuting the parts of $\lambda$, the stationary probability of being in state $\eta$ is proportional to the ASEP polynomial $F_{\eta}(x_1,\dots,x_n; q,t)$ at $q=1$; the normalizing constant (or partition function) is the Macdonald polynomial $P_{\lambda}(x_1,\dots,x_n;q,t)$ at $q=1$. Our approach involves new relations between the families of ASEP polynomials and of non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials at $q=1$. We also use multiline diagrams, showing that a single jump of the PushTASEP system is closely related to the operation of moving from one line to the next in a multiline diagram. We derive symmetry properties for the system under permutation of its jump rates, as well as a formula for the current of a single-species system.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 17:20:39 UTC (60 KB)"

"7","Can a GPT4-Powered AI Agent Be a Good Enough Performance Attribution Analyst?","Bruno de Melo","Computational Finance (q-fin.CP)","Performance attribution analysis, defined as the process of explaining the drivers of the excess performance of an investment portfolio against a benchmark, stands as a significant aspect of portfolio management and plays a crucial role in the investment decision-making process, particularly within the fund management industry. Rooted in a solid financial and mathematical framework, the importance and methodologies of this analytical technique are extensively documented across numerous academic research papers and books. The integration of large language models (LLMs) and AI agents marks a groundbreaking development in this field. These agents are designed to automate and enhance the performance attribution analysis by accurately calculating and analyzing portfolio performances against benchmarks. In this study, we introduce the application of an AI Agent for a variety of essential performance attribution tasks, including the analysis of performance drivers and utilizing LLMs as calculation engine for multi-level attribution analysis and question-answer (QA) exercises. Leveraging advanced prompt engineering techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Plan and Solve (PS), and employing a standard agent framework from LangChain, the research achieves promising results: it achieves accuracy rates exceeding 93% in analyzing performance drivers, attains 100% in multi-level attribution calculations, and surpasses 84% accuracy in QA exercises that simulate official examination standards. These findings affirm the impactful role of AI agents, prompt engineering and evaluation in advancing portfolio management processes, highlighting a significant advancement in the practical application and evaluation of AI technologies within the domain.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 17:12:57 UTC (2,055 KB)"

With this result, the story for kernel density estimation on all symmetric spaces is completed. The idea in adapting the proof for Euclidean space is to suitably abstract vector space operations on Euclidean space to both actions of symmetric groups and reparametrizations of Helgason-Fourier transforms and to use the fact that the exponential map for symmetric spaces of non-compact type defines a diffeomorphism.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 17:12:33 UTC (13 KB)"
"9","Complete equational theories for classical and quantum Gaussian relations","Robert I. Booth, Titouan Carette, Cole Comfort","Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)","We give generators and relations for the hypergraph props of Gaussian relations and positive affine Lagrangian relations. The former extends Gaussian probabilistic processes by completely-uninformative priors, and the latter extends Gaussian quantum mechanics with infinitely-squeezed states. These presentations are given by adding a generator to the presentation of real affine relations and of real affine Lagrangian relations which freely codiscards effects, as well as certain rotations. The presentation of positive affine Lagrangian relations provides a rigorous justification for many common yet informal calculations in the quantum physics literature involving infinite-squeezing. Our presentation naturally extends Menicucci et al.'s graph-theoretic representation of Gaussian quantum states with a representation for Gaussian transformations. We interpret the LOv-calculus, a diagrammatic calculus for reasoning about passive linear-optical quantum circuits in our presentation of positive affine Lagrangian relations. Moreover, we show how our presentation allows for additional optical operations such as active squeezing.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 17:09:24 UTC (420 KB)"

"11","Stochastic integration with respect to cylindrical Lévy processes in Hilbert spaces","Gergely Bodó, Markus Riedle","Probability (math.PR)","In this work, we present a comprehensive theory of stochastic integration with respect to arbitrary cylindrical Lévy processes in Hilbert spaces. Since cylindrical Lévy processes do not enjoy a semi-martingale decomposition, our approach relies on an alternative approach to stochastic integration by decoupled tangent sequences. The space of deterministic integrands is identified as a modular space described in terms of the characteristics of the cylindrical Lévy process. The space of random integrands is described as the space of predictable processes whose trajectories are in the space of deterministic integrands almost surely. The derived space of random integrands is verified as the largest space of potential integrands, based on a classical definition of stochastic integrability. We apply the introduced theory of stochastic integration to establish a dominated convergence theorem.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 16:41:47 UTC (37 KB)"
"12","Stationary non-radial localized patterns in the planar Swift-Hohenberg PDE: constructive proofs of existence","Matthieu Cadiot, Jean-Philippe Lessard, Jean-Christophe Nave","Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)","In this paper, we present a methodology for establishing constructive proofs of existence of smooth, stationary, non-radial localized patterns in the planar Swift-Hohenberg equation. Specifically, given an approximate solution $u_0$, we construct an approximate inverse for the linearization around $u_0$, enabling the development of a Newton-Kantorovich approach. Consequently, we derive a sufficient condition for the existence of a unique localized pattern in the vicinity of $u_0$. The verification of this condition is facilitated through a combination of analytic techniques and rigorous numerical computations. Moreover, an additional condition is derived, establishing that the localized pattern serves as the limit of a family of periodic solutions (in space) as the period tends to infinity. The integration of analytical tools and meticulous numerical analysis ensures a comprehensive validation of this condition. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology, we present computer-assisted proofs for the existence of three distinct unbounded branches of periodic solutions in the planar Swift-Hohenberg equation, all converging towards a localized planar pattern, whose existence is also proven constructively. All computer-assisted proofs, including the requisite codes, are accessible on GitHub at \cite{julia_cadiot}.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 16:33:57 UTC (2,145 KB)"

Purcell, Saul Schleimer","Geometric Topology (math.GT)","This paper employs knot invariants and results from hyperbolic geometry to develop a practical procedure for checking the cosmetic surgery conjecture on any given one-cusped manifold. This procedure has been used to establish the following computational results. First, we verify that all knots up to 19 crossings, and all one-cusped 3-manifolds in the SnapPy census, do not admit any purely cosmetic surgeries. Second, we check that a hyperbolic knot with at most 15 crossings only admits chirally cosmetic surgeries when the knot itself is amphicheiral. Third, we enumerate all knots up to 13 crossings that share a common Dehn fillings with the figure-8 knot. The code that verifies these results is publicly available on GitHub.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 16:31:27 UTC (54 KB)"

Players with an initially short position of stocks are only allowed to buy while players with an initially long position are only allowed to sell the stock. Under suitable conditions on the model parameters we show that the games are equivalent to games of timing where the players need to determine the optimal times of market entry and exit. We identify the equilibrium entry and exit times and prove that equilibrium mean-trading rates can be characterized in terms of the solutions to a highly non-linear higher-order integral equation with endogenous terminal condition. We prove the existence of a unique solution to the integral equation from which we obtain the existence of a unique equilibrium both in the mean-field and the $N$-player game.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 16:27:30 UTC (83 KB)"

The first step of the procedure is an estimation of how many elementary collisions is safe to take before chances of exiting the domain are too high; then these collisions are aggregated into a single movement. The method does not use any model nor any particular regime of parameters. We give theoretical results both under the normal approximation and without it and test the method on some benchmarks from the literature. The results confirm the theoretical predictions and show that the proposal is an efficient method to sample the escape distribution of the particle.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 16:10:36 UTC (754 KB)"

"20","Convergence and Trade-Offs in Riemannian Gradient Descent and Riemannian Proximal Point","David Martínez-Rubio, Christophe Roux, Sebastian Pokutta","Optimization and Control (math.OC)","In this work, we analyze two of the most fundamental algorithms in geodesically convex optimization: Riemannian gradient descent and (possibly inexact) Riemannian proximal point. We quantify their rates of convergence and produce different variants with several trade-offs. Crucially, we show the iterates naturally stay in a ball around an optimizer, of radius depending on the initial distance and, in some cases, on the curvature. In contrast, except for limited cases, previous works bounded the maximum distance between iterates and an optimizer only by assumption, leading to incomplete analyses and unquantified rates. We also provide an implementable inexact proximal point algorithm yielding new results on minmax problems, and we prove several new useful properties of Riemannian proximal methods: they work when positive curvature is present, the proximal operator does not move points away from any optimizer, and we quantify the smoothness of its induced Moreau envelope. Further, we explore beyond our theory with empirical tests.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 16:06:40 UTC (2,505 KB)"

Synthetic data generation offers potential solutions. Many metrics exist for evaluating the quality of synthetic tabular data; however, we lack an objective, coherent interpretation of the many metrics. To address this issue, we propose an evaluation framework with a single, mathematical objective that posits that the synthetic data should be drawn from the same distribution as the observed data. Through various structural decomposition of the objective, this framework allows us to reason for the first time the completeness of any set of metrics, as well as unifies existing metrics, including those that stem from fidelity considerations, downstream application, and model-based approaches. Moreover, the framework motivates model-free baselines and a new spectrum of metrics. We evaluate structurally informed synthesizers and synthesizers powered by deep learning. Using our structured framework, we show that synthetic data generators that explicitly represent tabular structure outperform other methods, especially on smaller datasets.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 15:58:37 UTC (112 KB)"
"22","Quantization Avoids Saddle Points in Distributed Optimization","Yanan Bo, Yongqiang Wang","Optimization and Control (math.OC)","Distributed nonconvex optimization underpins key functionalities of numerous distributed systems, ranging from power systems, smart buildings, cooperative robots, vehicle networks to sensor networks. Recently, it has also merged as a promising solution to handle the enormous growth in data and model sizes in deep learning. A fundamental problem in distributed nonconvex optimization is avoiding convergence to saddle points, which significantly degrade optimization accuracy. We discover that the process of quantization, which is necessary for all digital communications, can be exploited to enable saddle-point avoidance. More specifically, we propose a stochastic quantization scheme and prove that it can effectively escape saddle points and ensure convergence to a second-order stationary point in distributed nonconvex optimization. With an easily adjustable quantization granularity, the approach allows a user to control the number of bits sent per iteration and, hence, to aggressively reduce the communication overhead. Numerical experimental results using distributed optimization and learning problems on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of the approach.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 15:58:20 UTC (2,937 KB)"

Concretely, for Gaussian robust $k$-sparse mean estimation on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with corruption rate $\epsilon>0$, our algorithm has sample complexity $(k^2/\epsilon^2)\mathrm{polylog}(d/\epsilon)$, runs in sample polynomial time, and approximates the target mean within $\ell_2$-error $O(\epsilon)$.

"25","Action Functional as Early Warning Indicator in the Space of Probability Measures","Peng Zhang, Ting Gao, Jin Guo, Jinqiao Duan","Dynamical Systems (math.DS)","In neuroscience, scientists have some hypotheses on the brain's critical dynamics, which means the brain may stay in a phase transition state between ordered and disordered activities. Some tipping points, as a past of no return, can be critical for neural diseases. Therefore, a key question is how the critical brain hypothesis relates to pathological conditions compared with normal brain functionality. Action functional between two meta-stable states in stochastic dynamical systems is a good tool to study the critical transition and tipping. Here we extend the conventional Onsager-Machlup action functional of finding the most probable transition pathway to be looking for the evolutionary transition dynamics between two meta-stable invariant sets. Hence a rich theory from Schrödinger Bridge and Optimal Transport is brought in to solve this problem. Furthermore, different from various early warning indicators via statistics, bifurcation theory, information theory, statistical physics, topology, graph theory, we propose a novel viewpoint of early warning indicators in the space of probability measure, which facilitates us to build indicators based on action functional. To validate our framework, we apply this methodology to a Morris-Lecar model introduced to analyze the transition dynamics between a meta-stable state and the homo-clinic orbit. Besides, the real Alzheimer's data from ADNI database is also investigated to study the early warning signals of transition from healthy to pre-AD states. This framework not only extends the transition path to be pathway measures between two given densities on invariant sets but also shows potential ability for early warning indicators or biomarkers in complex diseases.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 15:38:15 UTC (3,938 KB)"

This paper describes a study that systematically compared models for a university community, which has a much smaller but more connected population than a state or nation. We developed a stochastic agent-based model, a deterministic compartment model, and a model based on ordinary differential equations. All three models represented the disease progression with the same susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model. We created a baseline scenario for a population of 14,000 students and faculty and eleven other scenarios for combinations of interventions such as regular testing, contact tracing, quarantine, isolation, moving courses online, mask wearing, improving ventilation, and vaccination. We used parameter values from other epidemiological studies and incorporated data about COVID-19 testing in College Park, Maryland, but the study was designed to compare modeling approaches to each other using a synthetic population. For each scenario we used the models to estimate the number of persons who become infected over a semester of 119 days. We evaluated the models by comparing their predictions and evaluating their parsimony and computational effort. The agent-based model (ABM) and the deterministic compartment model (DCM) had similar results with cyclic flow of persons to and from quarantine, but the model based on ordinary differential equations failed to capture these dynamics. The ABM's computation time was much greater than the other two models' computation time. The DCM captured some of the dynamics that were present in the ABM's predictions and, like those from the ABM, clearly showed the importance of testing and moving classes on-line.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 15:36:14 UTC (829 KB)"

Specifically, the agents adopt the conditional value at risk (CVaR) as a risk measure with possibly different risk levels. To solve this problem, we propose a first-order risk-averse leaning algorithm, in which the CVaR gradient estimate depends on an estimate of the Value at Risk (VaR) value combined with the gradient of the stochastic cost function. Although estimation of the CVaR gradients using finitely many samples is generally biased, we show that the accumulated error of the CVaR gradient estimates is bounded with high probability. Moreover, assuming that the risk-averse game is strongly monotone, we show that the proposed algorithm converges to the risk-averse Nash equilibrium. We present numerical experiments on a Cournot game example to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 15:32:56 UTC (820 KB)"

The data of a general section of a suitably defined line bundle on $\mathcal F l(1,2,\mathcal E)$ defines two varieties: a cover $X_1$ of $B$ and a fibration $X_2$ on $B$ with general fiber isomorphic to a smooth Fano variety. We construct a semiorthogonal decomposition of the derived category of $X_2$ which consists of a list of exceptional objects and a subcategory equivalent to the derived category of $X_1$. As a byproduct, we obtain a new full exceptional collection for the Fano fourfold of degree $12$ and genus $7$. Any birational map of smooth projective varieties which is resolved by blowups with exceptional divisor $\mathcal F l(1, 2, \mathcal E)$ is an instance of a so-called Grassmann flip: we prove that the DK conjecture of Bondal-Orlov and Kawamata holds for such flips.

O'Grady","Dynamical Systems (math.DS)","We study the scattering of a vortex dipole by a point vortex in the Helmholtz model of point-vortex interactions. We reduce a system of three vortices by stages to a one-degree-of-freedom conservative system. We relate properties of the scattering dynamics to features in the phase space of the reduced system. We first change variables to the Jacobi coordinates, followed by a Nambu reduction. This shows that the natural phase space of this problem is the upper sheet of a two-sheeted hyperboloid, which degenerates to an upper half-cone in a critical case. Gröbli (1877) derived the standard reduction of this system in which the system's state is represented by the lengths of the triangle's sides. The new coordinate system overcomes two related shortcomings of Gröbli's reduction that have made understanding the dynamics difficult: the lack of a phase plane and the singularity at all configurations in which the vortices are collinear. We then generalize the problem to consider when the circulation of the third, initially stationary, vortex differs from the circulations of the two that form the propagating dipole.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 15:14:01 UTC (946 KB)"

For the case that A is a twisted group algebra in a linear abelian monoidal category we obtain a graded generalization of the Schur Lemma for the category of induced A-modules. We further show that if the monoidal category is braided and A is commutative up to a bicharacter of the grading group, then the category of induced A-modules can be endowed with a graded-monoidal structure that is twisted by the bicharacter. In the particular case that the grading group is Z/2Z, these findings reproduce known results about superalgebras and super-monoidal structures.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 14:58:31 UTC (36 KB)"
"33","An inflated dynamic Laplacian to track the emergence and disappearance of semi-material coherent sets","Jason Atnip, Gary Froyland, Péter Koltai","Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)","Lagrangian methods continue to stand at the forefront of the analysis of time-dependent dynamical systems. Most Lagrangian methods have criteria that must be fulfilled by trajectories as they are followed throughout a given finite flow duration. This key strength of Lagrangian methods can also be a limitation in more complex evolving environments. It places a high importance on selecting a time window that produces useful results, and these results may vary significantly with changes in the flow duration. We show how to overcome this drawback in the tracking of coherent flow features. Finite-time coherent sets (FTCS) are material objects that strongly resist mixing in complicated nonlinear flows. Like other materially coherent objects, by definition they must retain their coherence properties throughout the specified flow duration. Recent work [Froyland and Koltai, CPAM, 2023] introduced the notion of semi-material FTCS, whereby a balance is struck between the material nature and the coherence properties of FTCS. This balance provides the flexibility for FTCS to come and go, merge and separate, or undergo other changes as the governing unsteady flow experiences dramatic shifts. The purpose of this work is to illustrate the utility of the inflated dynamic Laplacian introduced in [Froyland and Koltai, CPAM, 2023] in a range of dynamical systems that are challenging to analyse by standard Lagrangian means, and to provide an efficient meshfree numerical approach for the discretisation of the inflated dynamic Laplacian.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 14:52:11 UTC (3,060 KB)"

Yet there is a significant challenge in forming focused, useful images due to multiple scattering effects through walls, whereas standard SAR imaging has an inherent single scattering assumption. This may be exacerbated with multi-static collections, since different scattering events will be observed from each angle and the data may not coherently combine well in a naive manner. To overcome this, we propose an image formation method which resolves full-wave effects through an approximately known wall or other arbitrary obstacle, which itself has some unknown ""nuisance"" parameters that are determined as part of the reconstruction to provide well focused images. The method is more flexible and realistic than existing methods which treat a single wall as a flat layered medium, whilst being significantly computationally cheaper than full-wave methods, strongly motivated by practical considerations for through-wall SAR.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 14:41:00 UTC (656 KB)"

Smooth tests that assemble a few components are also of great use in practice. To further improve testing efficiency, we introduce a component selection approach, aiming to identify the most contributory components.

If the series expansions of two periodic distributions have compatible coefficient estimates, then their product is a periodic tempered distribution. We connect product of tempered distributions with the product of shift-invariant elements of $V_s$. The idea for the analysis of products comes from the Hörmander's description of the Sobolev type wave front in connection with the product of distributions. Coefficient compatibility for the product of $f$ and $g$ in the case of ""good"" position of their Sobolev type wave fronts is proved in the 2-dimensional case. For larger dimension it is an open problem because of the difficulties on the description of the intersection of cones in dimension $d\geqslant3$.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 14:36:21 UTC (15 KB)"

In the blind setting, in which the source signals are not known, the localization task is challenging due to the data association problem. That is, it is not known which of the TDOA measurements correspond to the same source. Herein, we propose to perform joint localization and data association by means of an optimal transport formulation. The method operates by finding optimal groupings of TDOA measurements and associating these with candidate source locations. To allow for computationally feasible localization in three-dimensional space, an efficient set of candidate locations is constructed using a minimal multilateration solver based on minimal sets of receiver pairs. In numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method is robust both to measurement noise and TDOA detection errors. Furthermore, it is shown that the data association provided by the proposed method allows for statistically efficient estimates of the source locations.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 14:16:46 UTC (333 KB)"

This strategy is called cold-starting, and it is based on a map called the starting map, which is determined by an appropriately short history of observations that maps to a unique initial condition in the reservoir space. The time series generated by the reservoir system using that initial state can be used to run the system in autonomous mode, to produce accurate forecasts of the time series under consideration immediately. By utilizing this map, the lengthy ""washouts"" that are necessary to initialize reservoir systems can be eliminated, enabling the generation of forecasts using any selection of appropriately short histories of the observations.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 14:13:49 UTC (1,409 KB)"

We define supplement matrices for a dual Hermitian matrix. Supplement matrices are Hermitian matrices in the original ring. The standard parts of the eigenvalues of that dual Hermitian matrix are the eigenvalues of the standard part Hermitian matrix in the original ring, while the dual parts of the eigenvalues of that dual Hermitian matrix are the eigenvalues of those {supplement} matrices. Hence, by apply any practical method for computing eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices in the original ring, we have a practical method for computing eigenvalues of a dual Hermitian matrix. We call this method the supplement matrix method. Applications to low rank approximation and generalized inverses of dual matrices, dual least squares problem and formation control are discussed.

Kindzierski","Applications (stat.AP)","Males outnumber females in many high ability careers, for example, in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and professors in academic medicine. These differences are often attributed to implicit, subconscious, bias. One objective of this study was to use statistical p value plots to independently test the ability to support the claim of implicit bias made in a meta analysis of gender bias studies. The meta analysis examined correlations between implicit bias measures based on the gender Implicit Association Test, g IAT, and measures of intergroup, female and male, behavior. A second objective was to investigate general intelligence g and vocational, things people, interests as explanatory factors for gender differences in high ability careers. The p value plots constructed using data sets from the meta analysis did not support real associations between the tested variables. These findings reinforce the lack of correlation between g IAT, implicit bias, measures and real world gender behaviors in high ability careers. More demanding careers, attorneys, engineers, scientists, corporate executives, are recruited from people with higher g. One is dealing with gender groups and the group of high g females is smaller than high g males. Regarding vocational interests, females prefer working with people and males prefer working with things. STEM fields are typically things oriented. One is dealing with gender groups and the group of females who prefer working with things is smaller than the group of males. These facts make it predictable that there are more males in high complexity, things careers, STEM, academic medicine positions, than females. Implicit bias gIAT measures have little or no explanatory power for gender differences in high ability careers relative to g and interests in working with things.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 13:42:10 UTC (433 KB)"

This technique necessitates analysis-suitable parameterization of physical domains to fully harness the synergy between Computer-Aided Design and Computer-Aided Engineering analyses. The existing methods often fix boundary parameters, leading to challenges in elongated geometries such as fluid channels and tubular reactors. This paper presents an innovative solution for the boundary parameter matching problem, specifically designed for analysis-suitable parameterizations. We employ a sophisticated Schwarz-Christoffel mapping technique, which is instrumental in computing boundary correspondences. A refined boundary curve reparameterization process complements this. Our dual-strategy approach maintains the geometric exactness and continuity of input physical domains, overcoming limitations often encountered with the existing reparameterization techniques. By employing our proposed boundary parameter method, we show that even a simple linear interpolation approach can effectively construct a satisfactory analysis-suitable parameterization. Our methodology offers significant improvements over traditional practices, enabling the generation of analysis-suitable and geometrically precise models, which is crucial for ensuring accurate simulation results. Numerical experiments show the capacity of the proposed method to enhance the quality and reliability of isogeometric analysis workflows.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 13:27:03 UTC (12,888 KB)"

We prove a sharp weighted Hardy inequality on integers with power weights of the form $n^\alpha$. This is done via two different methods, namely super-solution and Fourier method. We also use Fourier method to prove a weighted Hardy type inequality for higher order operators. After discussing the one dimensional case, we study the Hardy inequality in higher dimensions ($d \geq 3$). In particular, we compute the asymptotic behaviour of the sharp constant in the discrete Hardy inequality, as $d \rightarrow \infty$. This is done by converting the inequality into a continuous Hardy-type inequality on a torus for functions having zero average. These continuous inequalities are new and interesting in themselves. In the second half, we focus our attention on analogues of Rearrangement inequalities on lattice graphs. We begin by analysing the situation in dimension one. We define various notions of rearrangements and prove the corresponding Polya-Szegő inequality. These inequalities are also applied to prove some weighted Hardy inequalities on integers. Finally, we study Rearrangement inequalities (Polya-Szegő) on general graphs, with a particular focus on lattice graphs $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for $d \geq 2$.

"53","Structural Preprocessing Method for Nonlinear Differential-Algebraic Equations Using Linear Symbolic Matrices","Taihei Oki, Yujin Song","Symbolic Computation (cs.SC)","Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) have been used in modeling various dynamical systems in science and engineering. Several preprocessing methods for DAEs, such as consistent initialization and index reduction, use structural information on DAEs. Unfortunately, these methods may fail when the system Jacobian, which is a functional matrix, derived from the DAE is singular. To transform a DAE with a singular system Jacobian into a nonsingular system, several regularization methods have been proposed. Most of all existing regularization methods rely on symbolic computation to eliminate the system Jacobian for finding a certificate of singularity, resulting in much computational time. Iwata--Oki--Takamatsu (2019) proposed a method (IOT-method) to find a certificate without symbolic computations. The IOT method approximates the system Jacobian by a simpler symbolic matrix, called a layered mixed matrix, which admits a fast combinatorial algorithm for singularity testing. However, it often overlooks the singularity of the system Jacobian since the approximation largely discards algebraic relationships among entries in the original system Jacobian. In this study, we propose a new regularization method extending the idea of the IOT method. Instead of layered mixed matrices, our method approximates the system Jacobian by more expressive symbolic matrices, called rank-1 coefficient mixed (1CM) matrices. This makes our method more widely applicable. We give a fast combinatorial algorithm for finding a singularity certificate of 1CM-matrices, which is free from symbolic elimination. Our method is also advantageous in that it globally preserves the solution set to the DAE. Through numerical experiments, we confirmed that our method runs fast for large-scale DAEs from real instances.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 12:48:41 UTC (259 KB)"

This is particularly relevant for survival analysis, where the adoption of IML techniques promotes transparency, accountability and fairness in sensitive areas, such as clinical decision making processes, the development of targeted therapies, interventions or in other medical or healthcare related contexts. More specifically, explainability can uncover a survival model's potential biases and limitations and provide more mathematically sound ways to understand how and which features are influential for prediction or constitute risk factors. However, the lack of readily available IML methods may have deterred medical practitioners and policy makers in public health from leveraging the full potential of machine learning for predicting time-to-event data. We present a comprehensive review of the limited existing amount of work on IML methods for survival analysis within the context of the general IML taxonomy.

The algorithm improves the numerical solution accuracy and the mesh quality through a controlled refinement strategy applied to the generic polygonal elements of the domain tessellation. The numerical results show that the outlined strategy proves to be versatile and applicable to any two-dimensional problem where polygonal meshes offer advantages. In particular, we focus on the simulation of flow in fractured media, specifically using the Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) model. A residual a-posteriori error estimator tailored for the DFN case is employed. We chose this particular application to emphasize the effectiveness of the algorithm in handling complex geometries. All the numerical tests demonstrate optimal convergence rates for all the tested VEM orders.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 11:10:49 UTC (3,589 KB)"

As applications, we prove the projective bundle and blow-up formulas for refined unramified cohomology groups and we reduce the Rost nilpotence principle in characteristic zero to a statement concerning certain refined unramified cohomology groups. Moreover, we compute the refined unramified cohomology for smooth proper linear varieties and show that Rost's nilpotence principle holds for these varieties in characteristic zero.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 11:01:33 UTC (35 KB)"

To overcome the challenges posed by these constraints, an asymptotic difference-of-convex (ADC) method that employs a Moreau smoothing approach and an exact penalty approach is proposed to transform this problem into a DC programming format gradually. To solve the gained DC programming, by making full use of its DC structure, an efficient inexact DC algorithm with sieving strategy (siDCA) is introduced. The subproblem of siDCA is solved by an efficient dual-based semismooth Newton method. The convergence of the solution sequence generated by siDCA is proved. To illustrate the effectiveness of ADC-siDCA, matrix recovery experiments on nonnegative and positive semidefinite matrices. The numerical results are compared with those obtained using a successive DC approximation minimization method and a penalty proximal alternating linearized minimization approach. The outcome of the comparison indicates that ADC-siDCA surpasses the other two methods in terms of efficiency and recovery error. Additionally, numerical experiments on sparse phase retrieval demonstrate that ADC-siDCA is a valuable tool for recovering sparse and low-rank Hermitian matrices.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 10:36:31 UTC (3,732 KB)"

The evidence is based on convincing numerics that a KAM theorem can be applied to the Hamiltonian equations of the model to produce quasiperiodic motion (on an invariant torus) with the appropriate frequencies. To do so, we first use KAM numerical schemes to compute translated tori to continue from the Kepler approximation (two uncoupled two-body problems) up to the actual Hamiltonian of the system, for which the translated torus is an invariant torus. Second, we use KAM numerical schemes for invariant tori to refine the solution giving the desired torus. Lastly, the convergence of the KAM scheme for the invariant torus is (numerically) checked by applying several times a KAM iterative lemma, from which we obtain that the final torus (numerically) satisfies the existence conditions given by a KAM theorem.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 09:52:54 UTC (873 KB)"
"71","Self-Aligning Polar Active Matter","Paul Baconnier, Olivier Dauchot, Vincent Démery, Gustavo Düring, Silke Henkes, Cristián Huepe, Amir Shee","Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)","Self-alignment describes the property of a polar active unit to align or anti-align its orientation towards its velocity. In contrast to mutual alignment, where the headings of multiple active units tend to directly align to each other -- as in the celebrated Vicsek model --, self-alignment impacts the dynamics at the individual level by coupling the rotation and displacements of each active unit. This enriches the dynamics even without interactions or external forces, and allows, for example, a single self-propelled particle to orbit in a harmonic potential. At the collective level, self-alignment modifies the nature of the transition to collective motion already in the mean field description, and it can also lead to other forms of self-organization such as collective actuation in dense or solid elastic assemblies of active units. This has significant implications for the study of dense biological systems, metamaterials, and swarm robotics. Here, we review a number of models that were introduced independently to describe the previously overlooked property of self-alignment and identify some of its experimental realizations. Our aim is three-fold: (i)~underline the importance of self-alignment in active systems, especially in the context of dense populations of active units and active solids; (ii)~provide a unified mathematical and conceptual framework for the description of self-aligning systems; (iii)~discuss the common features and specific differences of the existing models of self-alignment. We conclude by discussing promising research avenues in which the concept of self-alignment could play a significant role.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 09:51:07 UTC (24,367 KB)"

We explore the numerical pitfalls of applying standard extreme value techniques to model multiday extremes. Then, we illustrate that our data conforms to the appropriate setting for the application of recently derived extreme value distributions for runs of extremes in the dynamical framework and adapt these to the non-stationary setting. Finally, we use these distributions to make more informed predictions on the return times and magnitudes of consecutive daily extreme precipitation and find changes in the dependence of increasing consecutive daily rainfall extremes on the Southern Oscillation Index. Although our case study is focused on extreme precipitation across eastern Australia, we emphasize that these techniques can be used to model expected returns and magnitudes of consecutive extreme precipitation events across many locations.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 09:38:08 UTC (2,383 KB)"

We show that up to topological isotopy rel. boundary, such disks necessarily arise by performing a positive crossing change on $K$ to an Alexander polynomial one knot and capping off with a $\mathbb{Z}$-disk in $D^4.$ Such a crossing change determines a loop in $S^3 \setminus K$ and we prove that the homology class of its lift to the infinite cyclic cover leads to a complete invariant of the disk. We prove that this determines a bijection between the set of rel. boundary topological isotopy classes of $\mathbb{Z}$-disks with boundary $K$ and a quotient of the set of unitary units of the ring $\mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm 1}]/(\Delta_K)$. Number-theoretic considerations allow us to deduce that a knot $K \subset S^3$ with quadratic Alexander polynomial bounds $0,1,2,4$, or infinitely many $\mathbb{Z}$-disks in $(\mathbb{C} P^2)^\circ$. This leads to the first examples of knots bounding infinitely many topologically distinct disks whose exteriors have the same fundamental group and equivariant intersection form.

For mapping class groups, relatively hyperbolic groups, CAT(-1) groups and CAT(0) cubical groups, we further discuss analyticity of the escape rate. Finally, assuming that the action of $G$ on $X$ is weakly properly discontinuous (WPD), we discuss continuity of the asymptotic entropy of random walks on $G$.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 03:26:38 UTC (724 KB)"

"100","SO(n) AKLT Chains as Symmetry Protected Topological Quantum Ground States","Michael Ragone","Mathematical Physics (math-ph)","This thesis studies a pair of symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases which arise when considering one-dimensional quantum spin systems possessing a natural orthogonal group symmetry. Particular attention is given to a family of exactly solvable models whose ground states admit a matrix product state description and generalize the AKLT chain. We call these models ``$SO(n)$ AKLT chains'' and the phase they occupy the ``$SO(n)$ Haldane phase''. We present new results describing their ground state structure and, when $n$ is even, their peculiar $O(n)$-to-$SO(n)$ symmetry breaking. We also prove that these states have arbitrarily large correlation and injectivity length by increasing $n$, but all have a 2-local parent Hamiltonian, in contrast to the natural expectation that the interaction range of a parent Hamiltonian should diverge as these quantities diverge. We extend Ogata's definition of an SPT index for a split state for a finite symmetry group $G$ to an SPT index for a compact Lie group $G$. We then compute this index, which takes values in the second Borel group cohomology $H^2(SO(n),U(1))$, at a single point in each of the SPT phases. The two points have different indices, confirming the two SPT phases are indeed distinct. Chapter 1 contains an introduction with a detailed overview of the contents of this thesis, which includes several chapters of background information before presenting new results in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8.","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 01:22:49 UTC (917 KB)"

Both of our algorithms combine matrix completion techniques for a small number of slices along with Jennrich's algorithm to learn the factors corresponding to the first two modes, and then solve systems of linear equations to learn the factors corresponding to the remaining modes. For order-$3$ tensors, our algorithms follow a ""sandwich"" sampling strategy that more densely samples a few outer slices (the bread), and then more sparsely samples additional inner slices (the bbq-braised tofu) for the final completion. For an order-$d$, CP-rank $r$ tensor of size $n \times \cdots \times n$ that satisfies mild assumptions, our adaptive sampling algorithm recovers the CP-decomposition with high probability while using at most $O(nr\log r + dnr)$ samples and $O(n^2r^2+dnr^2)$ operations. Our nonadaptive sampling algorithm recovers the CP-decomposition with high probability while using at most $O(dnr^2\log n + nr\log^2 n)$ samples and runs in polynomial time.

Cohesive elements are a versatile and physically representative way of modelling delamination. However, using their standard form which conforms to solid substrate elements, multiple elements are required in the narrow cohesive zone, thereby requiring an excessively fine mesh and hindering the applicability in practical scenarios. The present work focuses on the implementation and testing of triangular thin plate substrate elements and compatible cohesive elements, which satisfy C1-continuity in the domain. The improved regularity meets the continuity requirement coming from the Kirchhoff Plate Theory and the triangular shape allows for conformity to complex geometries. The overall model is validated for mode I delamination, the case with the smallest cohesive zone. Very accurate predictions of the limit load and crack propagation phase are achieved, using elements as large as 11 times the cohesive zone.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 22:09:17 UTC (4,757 KB)"

These frameworks are then used to resolve some long-outstanding problems in theoretical physics, coming from critical statistical models and conformal field theory. I describe these problems and the difficulties involved in finding satisfactory solutions, then show how the concepts of emerging Jordan forms and dual Jordan quantum physics are naturally suited to overcoming these difficulties. Although their applications in this work are limited in scope to rather specific problems, the frameworks themselves are completely general, and I describe ways in which they may be used in other areas of mathematics and physics.

The vast majority of the input uncertainty literature focuses on estimating target output quantities that are real-valued. However, outputs of simulation models are random and real-valued targets essentially serve only as summary statistics. To provide a more holistic assessment, we study the input uncertainty problem from a distributional view, namely we construct confidence bands for the entire output distribution function. Our approach utilizes a novel test statistic whose asymptotic consists of the supremum of the sum of a Brownian bridge and a suitable mean-zero Gaussian process, which generalizes the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic to account for input uncertainty. Regarding implementation, we also demonstrate how to use subsampling to efficiently estimate the covariance function of the Gaussian process, thereby leading to an implementable estimation of the quantile of the test statistic and a statistically valid confidence band. Numerical results demonstrate how our new confidence bands provide valid coverage for output distributions under input uncertainty that is not achievable by conventional approaches.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 21:16:12 UTC (1,564 KB)"

We begin by establishing a Berezin integral formulation of the SPPM problem, showcasing its versatility through various symmetries including $SU(n)$, its subgroups, and particle-hole symmetry. This representation not only facilitates new analytical approaches but also offers deeper insights into the symmetries of complex quantum systems. For instance, it enables the representation of the Hubbard model's partition function in terms of the SPPM problem. We further develop three mean field techniques to approximate SPPM, each providing unique perspectives and utilities: the first method focuses on the evolution of symmetries post-mean field approximation, the second, based on the bosonic representation, enhances our understanding of the stability of mean field results, and the third employs a variational approach to establish a lower bound for SPPM. These methods converge to identical consistency relations and values for SPPM, illustrating their robustness. The practical applications of our theoretical advancements are demonstrated through two compelling case studies. First, we exactly solve the SPPM problem for the Laplacian matrix of a chain, a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, allowing for precise benchmarking of mean-field theory results. Second, we present the first analytical calculation of the Shannon-Rényi entropy for the transverse field Ising chain, revealing critical insights into phase transitions and symmetry breaking in the ferromagnetic phase.

Such limitation is hard to ignore when modulation schemes and hardware platforms have become extremely diverse. This paper presents a new paradigm of using neural networks as an abstraction layer for physical layer modulators in IoT gateway devices, referred to as NN-defined modulators. Our approach addresses the challenges of extensibility and portability for multiple technologies on various hardware platforms. The proposed NN-defined modulator uses a model-driven methodology rooted in solid mathematical foundations while having native support for hardware acceleration and portability to heterogeneous platforms. We conduct the evaluation of NN-defined modulators on different platforms, including Nvidia Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi. Evaluations demonstrate that our NN-defined modulator effectively operates as conventional modulators and provides significant efficiency gains (up to $4.7\times$ on Nvidia Jetson Nano and $1.1\times$ on Raspberry Pi), indicating high portability. Furthermore, we show the real-world applications using our NN-defined modulators to generate ZigBee and WiFi packets, which are compliant with commodity TI CC2650 (ZigBee) and Intel AX201 (WiFi NIC), respectively.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 20:42:23 UTC (3,145 KB)"

This has inspired the creation of tailored approaches that exploit historical data to inform heuristic design. Deep learning (DL) methods are typically used in this context to extract patterns from data, but they require large datasets and comprehensive hyperparameter tuning for strong performance. This article describes a one-shot learning heuristic that leverages solutions discovered within the branch-and-bound tree to construct a model with minimal overhead. We evaluate our method on the locomotive assignment problem (LAP) and sets of MIPLIB instances that contain constraints based on special ordered sets of type 1.

Moreover, the abstract language of nonnegative polynomials also leads to a unified mathematical approach to nonclassicality for light and spin systems, allowing us to map methods for one to the other. Conversely, the physical problems arising also inspire several mathematical insights into characterisation of nonnegative polynomials.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 18:56:18 UTC (357 KB)"

"132","Perturbative Expansion of Yang-Baxter Operators","Emanuele Zappala","Quantum Algebra (math.QA)","We study the deformations of a wide class of Yang-Baxter (YB) operators arising from Lie algebras. We relate the higher order deformations of YB operators to Lie algebra deformations. We show that the obstruction to integrating deformations of self-distributive (SD) objects lie in the corresponding Lie algebra third cohomology group, and interpret this result in terms of YB deformations. We show that there are YB operators that admit integrable deformations (i.e. that can be deformed infinitely many times), and that therefore give rise to a full perturbative series in the deformation parameter $\hbar$. We consider the second cohomology group of YB operators corresponding to certain types of Lie algebras, and show that this can be nontrivial even if the Lie algebra is rigid, providing examples of nontrivial YB deformations that do not arise from SD deformations.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 18:30:25 UTC (20 KB)"

We prove that all RFC subsets of a product $\prod\limits_{n\in\omega}X_n$ are countable, assuming that spaces $X_n$ are Tychonoff and all RFC subsets of every $X_n$ are countable. In particular, in a metrizable space every RFC subset is countable. The main tool in the proof is the following result: for every Tychonoff space $X$ and any countable set $Q \subseteq X$ there is a continuous function $f : X^\omega \to \mathbb{R}^2$ such that the restriction of $f$ to $Q^\omega$ is injective.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 18:06:59 UTC (6 KB)"

For each subset $P$ of primes of $F$ above $p$, there is the notion of partially classical Hilbert modular forms, where $P=\varnothing$ recovers the overconvergent forms and $P$ being the full set of primes above $p$ recovers classical forms. Given $P$, we $p$-adically interpolate the classical modular sheaves to construct families of partially classical Hilbert modular forms with weights varying in appropriate weight spaces. We then construct the corresponding eigenvariety, which recovers the eigenvariety constructed by Andreatta--Iovita--Pilloni when $P=\varnothing$. By contrast, it is unclear whether each partially classical form can be put into a partially classical family.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 18:06:57 UTC (24 KB)"
"137","Existence and uniqueness for the solutions of non-autonomous stochastic differential algebraic equations with locally Lipschitz coefficients","Oana Silvia Serea, Antoine Tambue, Guy Tsafack","Probability (math.PR)","In this paper, we study the well-posedness and regularity of non-autonomous stochastic differential algebraic equations (SDAEs) with nonlinear, locally Lipschitz and monotone (2) coefficients of the form (1). The main difficulty is the fact that the operator A(.) is non-autonomous, i.~e. depends on t and the matrix $A(t)$ is singular for all $t\in \left[0,T\right]$. Our interest is in SDAE of index-1. This means that in order to solve the problem, we can transform the initial SDAEs into an ordinary stochastic differential equation with algebraic constraints. Under appropriate hypothesizes, the main result establishes the existence and uniqueness of the solution in $\mathcal{M}^p(\left[0, T\right], \mathbb{R}^n)$, $p\geq 2$, $p\in \mathbb{N}$. Several strong estimations and regularity results are also provided. Note that, in this paper, we use various techniques such as Itô's lemma, Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality, and Young inequality.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 18:00:51 UTC (22 KB)"
"138","The Geometry of GTPs and 5d SCFTs","Guillermo Arias-Tamargo, Sebastián Franco, Diego Rodríguez-Gómez","High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)","We make progress in understanding the geometry associated to the Generalized Toric Polygons (GTPs) encoding the Physics of 5d Superconformal Field Theories (SCFTs), by exploiting the connection between Hanany-Witten transitions and the mathematical notion of polytope mutations. From this correspondence, it follows that the singular geometry associated to a GTP is identical to that obtained by regarding it as a standard toric diagram, but with some of its resolutions frozen in way that can be determined from the invariance of the so-called period under mutations. We propose the invariance of the period as a new criterion for distinguishing inequivalent brane webs, which allows us to resolve a puzzle posed in the literature. A second mutation invariant is the Hilbert Series of the geometry. We employ this invariant to perform quantitative checks of our ideas by computing the Hilbert Series of the BPS quivers associated to theories related by mutation. Lastly, we discuss the physical interpretation of a mathematical result ensuring the existence of a flat fibration over $\mathbb{P}^1$ interpolating between geometries connected by mutation, which we identify with recently introduced deformations of the corresponding BPS quivers.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 18:00:05 UTC (234 KB)"
"139","On the Impact of Co-Optimizing Station Locations, Trip Assignment, and Charging Schedules for Electric Buses","Rito Brata Nath, Tarun Rambha, Maximilian Schiffer","Optimization and Control (math.OC)","As many public transportation systems around the world transition to electric buses, the planning and operation of fleets can be improved via tailored decision-support tools. In this work, we study the impact of jointly locating charging facilities, assigning electric buses to trips, and determining when and where to charge the buses. We propose a mixed integer linear program that co-optimizes planning and operational decisions jointly and an iterated local search heuristic to solve large-scale instances. Herein, we use a concurrent scheduler algorithm to generate an initial feasible solution, which serves as a starting point for our iterated local search algorithm. In the sequential case, we first optimize trip assignments and charging locations. Charging schedules are then determined after fixing the optimal decisions from the first level. The joint model, on the other hand, integrates charge scheduling within the local search procedure. The solution quality of the joint and sequential iterated local search models are compared for multiple real-world bus transit networks. Our results demonstrate that joint models can help further improve operating costs by 14.1% and lower total costs by about 4.1% on average compared with sequential models. In addition, energy consumption costs and contracted power capacity costs have been reduced significantly due to our integrated planning approach.","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 16:04:20 UTC (2,696 KB)"

As is well known, the monotone stationary solution under the Bohm criterion can be referred to as the sheath which is formed by interactions of plasma with wall. So far, the existence and asymptotic stability of stationary solutions in one-dimensional half space to the full Euler-Poisson system have been proved in \cite{DYZ2021}. In the present paper, we extend the results in \cite{DYZ2021} to $N$-dimensional ($N$=1,2,3) half space. By assuming that the velocity of the positive ion satisfies the Bohm criterion at the far field, we establish the global unique existence and the large time asymptotic stability of the sheath in some weighted Sobolev spaces by weighted energy method. Moreover, the time-decay rates are also obtained. A key different point from \cite{DYZ2021} is to derive some boundary estimates on the derivative of the potential in the $x_1$-direction.","Wed, 13 Mar 2024 02:09:35 UTC (23 KB)"

We Show that $\varphi_{a,b,c}$ (respectively $1/\varphi_{a,b,c}$) is strictly convex on $(0,1)$ if and only if $c\leq -2\gamma-\psi(a)-\psi(b),$ (respectively $c\geq\alpha_0$) and $\varphi_{a,b,c}$ (respectively $1/\varphi_{a,b,c}$) is strictly concave on $(0,1)$ if and only if $c\geq c(a,b)$ (respectively $c\in[\delta_-,\delta_+]$), where $\psi$ is the Polygamma function. This generalizes some problems posed by Yang and Tian and complete the study of convexity properties of functions studied by the author in [bouali]. As applications of the convexity and concavity, we establish among other inequalities, that for all $x\in(0,1)$, $a,b\in[0,1]$, $a+b\leq 1$ and $c\geq c(a,b)$ $$c+\frac{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a+b)}\leq \frac{c-\log(1-x)}{\,_2F_1(a,b,a+b,x)}+\frac{c-\log(x)}{\,_2F_1(a,b,a+b,1-x)}\leq\frac{(2c+2\log 2)}{\,_2{F}_1(a,b;a+b;1/2)},$$ and for all $x\in(0,1)$, $a,b\in[0,1]$, $a+b\leq 1$ and $c\in [\delta_-,\delta_+]$ $$\frac1c+\frac{\Gamma(a+b)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}\leq \frac{\,_2F_1(a,b,a+b,x)}{c-\log(1-x)}+\frac{\,_2F_1(a,b,a+b,1-x)}{c-\log(x)}\leq\frac{\,_2{F}_1(a,b;a+b;1/2)}{(2c+2\log 2)}.$$","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 16:43:45 UTC (46 KB)"
