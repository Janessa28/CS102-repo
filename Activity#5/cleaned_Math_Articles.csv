"packing the largest trees in the tree packing conjecture","barnabás janzer, richard montgomery","combinatorics","the famous tree packing conjecture of gyárfás from 1976 says that any sequence of trees $t_1,\ldots,t_n$ such that $|t_i|=i$ for each $i\in [n]$ packs into the complete $n$-vertex graph $k_n$. packing even just the largest trees in such a sequence has proven difficult, with bollobás drawing attention to this in 1995 by conjecturing that, for each $k$, if $n$ is sufficiently large then the largest $k$ trees in any such sequence can be packed into $k_n$. this has only been shown for $k\leq 5$, by żak, despite many partial results and much related work on the full tree packing conjecture. we prove bollobás's conjecture, by showing that, moreover, a linear number of the largest trees can be packed in the tree packing conjecture.",2024-03-15

"data-driven distributionally robust safety verification using barrier certificates and conditional mean embeddings","oliver schön, zhengang zhong, sadegh soudjani","systems and control","algorithmic verification of realistic systems to satisfy safety and other temporal requirements has suffered from poor scalability of the employed formal approaches. to design systems with rigorous guarantees, many approaches still rely on exact models of the underlying systems. since this assumption can rarely be met in practice, models have to be inferred from measurement data or are bypassed completely. whilst former usually requires the model structure to be known a-priori and immense amounts of data to be available, latter gives rise to a plethora of restrictive mathematical assumptions about the unknown dynamics. in a pursuit of developing scalable formal verification algorithms without shifting the problem to unrealistic assumptions, we employ the concept of barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a compact set of system trajectories. we use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel hilbert space (rkhs) and construct an rkhs ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result w.r.t. a set of plausible transition kernels. we show how to solve the resulting program efficiently using sum-of-squares optimization and a gaussian process envelope. our approach lifts the need for restrictive assumptions on the system dynamics and uncertainty, and suggests an improvement in the sample complexity of verifying the safety of a system on a tested case study compared to a state-of-the-art approach.",2024-03-15

"quantization avoids saddle points in distributed optimization","yanan bo, yongqiang wang","optimization and control","distributed nonconvex optimization underpins key functionalities of numerous distributed systems, ranging from power systems, smart buildings, cooperative robots, vehicle networks to sensor networks. recently, it has also merged as a promising solution to handle the enormous growth in data and model sizes in deep learning. a fundamental problem in distributed nonconvex optimization is avoiding convergence to saddle points, which significantly degrade optimization accuracy. we discover that the process of quantization, which is necessary for all digital communications, can be exploited to enable saddle-point avoidance. more specifically, we propose a stochastic quantization scheme and prove that it can effectively escape saddle points and ensure convergence to a second-order stationary point in distributed nonconvex optimization. with an easily adjustable quantization granularity, the approach allows a user to control the number of bits sent per iteration and, hence, to aggressively reduce the communication overhead. numerical experimental results using distributed optimization and learning problems on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of the approach.",2024-03-15

"action functional as early warning indicator in the space of probability measures","peng zhang, ting gao, jin guo, jinqiao duan","dynamical systems","in neuroscience, scientists have some hypotheses on the brain's critical dynamics, which means the brain may stay in a phase transition state between ordered and disordered activities. some tipping points, as a past of no return, can be critical for neural diseases. therefore, a key question is how the critical brain hypothesis relates to pathological conditions compared with normal brain functionality. action functional between two meta-stable states in stochastic dynamical systems is a good tool to study the critical transition and tipping. here we extend the conventional onsager-machlup action functional of finding the most probable transition pathway to be looking for the evolutionary transition dynamics between two meta-stable invariant sets. hence a rich theory from schrödinger bridge and optimal transport is brought in to solve this problem. furthermore, different from various early warning indicators via statistics, bifurcation theory, information theory, statistical physics, topology, graph theory, we propose a novel viewpoint of early warning indicators in the space of probability measure, which facilitates us to build indicators based on action functional. to validate our framework, we apply this methodology to a morris-lecar model introduced to analyze the transition dynamics between a meta-stable state and the homo-clinic orbit. besides, the real alzheimer's data from adni database is also investigated to study the early warning signals of transition from healthy to pre-ad states. this framework not only extends the transition path to be pathway measures between two given densities on invariant sets but also shows potential ability for early warning indicators or biomarkers in complex diseases.",2024-03-15
"modeling the spread of covid-19 in university communities","jeffrey w. herrmann, hongjie liu, donald k. milton","populations and evolution","mathematical and simulation models are often used to predict the spread of a disease and estimate the impact of public health interventions, and many such models have been developed and used during the covid-19 pandemic. this paper describes a study that systematically compared models for a university community, which has a much smaller but more connected population than a state or nation. we developed a stochastic agent-based model, a deterministic compartment model, and a model based on ordinary differential equations. all three models represented the disease progression with the same susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (seir) model. we created a baseline scenario for a population of 14,000 students and faculty and eleven other scenarios for combinations of interventions such as regular testing, contact tracing, quarantine, isolation, moving courses online, mask wearing, improving ventilation, and vaccination. we used parameter values from other epidemiological studies and incorporated data about covid-19 testing in college park, maryland, but the study was designed to compare modeling approaches to each other using a synthetic population. for each scenario we used the models to estimate the number of persons who become infected over a semester of 119 days. we evaluated the models by comparing their predictions and evaluating their parsimony and computational effort. the agent-based model (abm) and the deterministic compartment model (dcm) had similar results with cyclic flow of persons to and from quarantine, but the model based on ordinary differential equations failed to capture these dynamics. the abm's computation time was much greater than the other two models' computation time. the dcm captured some of the dynamics that were present in the abm's predictions and, like those from the abm, clearly showed the importance of testing and moving classes on-line.",2024-03-15

"an inflated dynamic laplacian to track the emergence and disappearance of semi-material coherent sets","jason atnip, gary froyland, péter koltai","fluid dynamics","lagrangian methods continue to stand at the forefront of the analysis of time-dependent dynamical systems. most lagrangian methods have criteria that must be fulfilled by trajectories as they are followed throughout a given finite flow duration. this key strength of lagrangian methods can also be a limitation in more complex evolving environments. it places a high importance on selecting a time window that produces useful results, and these results may vary significantly with changes in the flow duration. we show how to overcome this drawback in the tracking of coherent flow features. finite-time coherent sets (ftcs) are material objects that strongly resist mixing in complicated nonlinear flows. like other materially coherent objects, by definition they must retain their coherence properties throughout the specified flow duration. recent work [froyland and koltai, cpam, 2023] introduced the notion of semi-material ftcs, whereby a balance is struck between the material nature and the coherence properties of ftcs. this balance provides the flexibility for ftcs to come and go, merge and separate, or undergo other changes as the governing unsteady flow experiences dramatic shifts. the purpose of this work is to illustrate the utility of the inflated dynamic laplacian introduced in [froyland and koltai, cpam, 2023] in a range of dynamical systems that are challenging to analyse by standard lagrangian means, and to provide an efficient meshfree numerical approach for the discretisation of the inflated dynamic laplacian.",2024-03-15

"resolving full-wave through-wall transmission effects in multi-static synthetic aperture radar","francis watson, daniel andre, william robert breckon lionheart","numerical analysis","through-wall synthetic aperture radar (sar) imaging is of significant interest for security purposes, in particular when using multi-static sar systems consisting of multiple distributed radar transmitters and receivers to improve resolution and the ability to recognise objects. yet there is a significant challenge in forming focused, useful images due to multiple scattering effects through walls, whereas standard sar imaging has an inherent single scattering assumption. this may be exacerbated with multi-static collections, since different scattering events will be observed from each angle and the data may not coherently combine well in a naive manner. to overcome this, we propose an image formation method which resolves full-wave effects through an approximately known wall or other arbitrary obstacle, which itself has some unknown ""nuisance"" parameters that are determined as part of the reconstruction to provide well focused images. the method is more flexible and realistic than existing methods which treat a single wall as a flat layered medium, whilst being significantly computationally cheaper than full-wave methods, strongly motivated by practical considerations for through-wall sar.",2024-03-15

"sun-jupiter-saturn system may exist: a verified computation of quasiperiodic solutions for the planar three body problem","jordi-lluís figueras, alex haro","dynamical systems","in this paper, we present evidence of the stability of a simplified model of the solar system, a flat (newtonian) sun-jupiter-saturn system with realistic data: masses of the sun and the planets, their semi-axes, eccentricities and (apsidal) precessions of the planets close to the real ones. the evidence is based on convincing numerics that a kam theorem can be applied to the hamiltonian equations of the model to produce quasiperiodic motion (on an invariant torus) with the appropriate frequencies. to do so, we first use kam numerical schemes to compute translated tori to continue from the kepler approximation (two uncoupled two-body problems) up to the actual hamiltonian of the system, for which the translated torus is an invariant torus. second, we use kam numerical schemes for invariant tori to refine the solution giving the desired torus. lastly, the convergence of the kam scheme for the invariant torus is (numerically) checked by applying several times a kam iterative lemma, from which we obtain that the final torus (numerically) satisfies the existence conditions given by a kam theorem.",2024-03-15

"convexity properties related to gauss hypergeometric function","mohamed bouali","general mathematics","we investigate the convexity property on $(0,1)$ of the functions $\varphi_{a,b,c}$ and $1/\varphi_{a,b,c}$, where $$\varphi_{a,b,c}(x)= \frac{c-\log(1-x)}{\,_2f_1(a,b,a+b,x)},$$ whenever $a,b\geq 0$ and $a+b\leq 1$. we show that $\varphi_{a,b,c}$ (respectively $1/\varphi_{a,b,c}$) is strictly convex on $(0,1)$ if and only if $c\leq -2\gamma-\psi(a)-\psi(b),$ (respectively $c\geq\alpha_0$) and $\varphi_{a,b,c}$ (respectively $1/\varphi_{a,b,c}$) is strictly concave on $(0,1)$ if and only if $c\geq c(a,b)$ (respectively $c\in[\delta_-,\delta_+]$), where $\psi$ is the polygamma function. this generalizes some problems posed by yang and tian and complete the study of convexity properties of functions studied by the author in [bouali]. as applications of the convexity and concavity, we establish among other inequalities, that for all $x\in(0,1)$, $a,b\in[0,1]$, $a+b\leq 1$ and $c\geq c(a,b)$ $$c+\frac{\gamma(a)\gamma(b)}{\gamma(a+b)}\leq \frac{c-\log(1-x)}{\,_2f_1(a,b,a+b,x)}+\frac{c-\log(x)}{\,_2f_1(a,b,a+b,1-x)}\leq\frac{(2c+2\log 2)}{\,_2{f}_1(a,b;a+b;1/2)},$$ and for all $x\in(0,1)$, $a,b\in[0,1]$, $a+b\leq 1$ and $c\in [\delta_-,\delta_+]$ $$\frac1c+\frac{\gamma(a+b)}{\gamma(a)\gamma(b)}\leq \frac{\,_2f_1(a,b,a+b,x)}{c-\log(1-x)}+\frac{\,_2f_1(a,b,a+b,1-x)}{c-\log(x)}\leq\frac{\,_2{f}_1(a,b;a+b;1/2)}{(2c+2\log 2)}.$$",2024-02-22
