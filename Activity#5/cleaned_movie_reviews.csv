"the super mario bros. movie (2023)","illumination's best since despicable me 1.","benjaminskylerhill","video games have long been plagued by subpar adaptions of their materials, but on their second attempt, the mario bros save the day. being on par with the likes of sonic and detective pikachu, this film hits all the fun beats you would want from a mario film. including plenty of fun moments for fans of the expansive franchise, this also stays completely understandable and entertaining for anyone who checks it out. with some interesting voice acting choices, no one took you out of the film and everyone felt like great choices for this vibrant world. wishing that it stood out more or took on more intriguing choices, i was still walking away happy and hopeful for the future of this franchise and the possibilities to come.","5 september 2023","8/10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"the super mario bros. movie (2023)","an absolute blast!","justinvitelli","sometimes you come across a movie that takes no risks. it's light on story, avoids character development, and focuses on getting to the next scene as easily as possible. mario bros. doesn't have any inherent plot holes or issues, but it tends to leave you in a state of just being a viewer rather than participating in the movie. in the end, it's not bad per se, but comes off as flat and lifeless.the positives are all agreed upon by anyone who likes it, because the positives stand out by not being able to be compared against anything else. people have fun with the action. they love the easter eggs. and the composed music is good. the action is done well, but without much dramatic weight, only carry the movie so far. easter eggs don't nor should have any bearing on how good the ovoid is. the music was well incorporated, minus the pop songs that truly don't work.it's not good enough to play things easy, and rely on fans to spot visual easter eggs, to call the movie good. it's average at best mostly because it was watchable and didn't have any outright flaws. it just didn't take chances that could've ended up becoming flaws. even if you had a good time watching it, there's not enough value to see it again. if you're a fan, check it out. if not, you won't miss a thing by skipping it.","5 april 2023","10/10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

""parabellum"" started to drop in quality, but it was still a solid flick. here john suddenly became a superhero that can take any hit and can fall from every height and he can just keep going like nothing happened. when chad stahelski directed the first movie he was not expecting all this success and when the production company ordered sequels, he did not really know how to develop this saga. now it is one of the biggest action franchises with a tv show that will be aired in the future and maybe with a 5th entry that was already approved. this got definitely out of hand and wick basically became the parody of himself, with scenes that have forced comedic moments that do not quite deliver. in my perspective they really do not know what to invent anymore. i really hope that in the future screenwriters and the director will come up with better ideas, because it is a series with potential and it showed it in the previous chapters, but in this case it just felt pointless and purposeless.","23 may 2023","4/10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

"john wick: chapter 4 (2023)","""yeah.""","imdbkeepsdeletingmyreviews","half of this review will be me gushing about the action. wow. just wow. i was in complete awe. there were multiple times i was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. now this is nothing new for the john wick series. but for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.i'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you snake eyes and mortal kombat). then i watch a john wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. the fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.there is every kind of fighting imaginable. so many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. so much creativity with the kills. amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol/sword combo is my fave).the music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. it enhances every action scene. the cinematography is pristine. so many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. it is stylistically beautiful.there are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that i've never seen before. one is an overhead shot one-take that i couldn't believe. it takes the movie to a new level. so many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. numerous times it feels like the vr game pistol whip.donnie yen is awesome. end of paragraph.about an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, i felt like i experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. i was in a state of ecstasy. not only was this looking like the best of the series, i started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.the subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. and his dog attacks were already done, and better, with halle berry in parabellum. a few of the issues i had with parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. for example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. and that's a mild example. also, it's fairly anticlimactic.even with those flaws, i had a blast with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. seeing it on a premium screen is a must. loudest speakers, biggest screen. trust me.edit: i was itching to go again since opening night. i wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. on second viewing, i still felt the same flaws, but i didn't care. the action is incredible. it has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. i want to watch these scenes a hundred times.it's definitely not perfect, but i still consider it an action landmark (last time i said that was mad max: fury road). every other action movie should learn from this. updating rating from 8 to 9 stars.(5 viewings, opening thursday ultrascreen 3/23/2023, ultrascreen 3/28/2023, superscreen 4/10/2023, re-issue imax 5/2/2023, 9/22/2023)","28 may 2023","5/10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"john wick: chapter 4 (2023)","disappointed.","dstan-71445","by now you know what to expect from a john wick movie. i thought the franchise was losing a little momentum in chapter 3 so i was worried this could be disappointing. it's not. it's even more on steroids than any wick before! even close to 3 hours it doesn't feel to long which is very special for a action movie. this franchise has set new standards. if anybody says a movie is good like john wick, it better f'n be! the set pieces as everyone mentioned before are really insane this time. the tokyo sceney with illuminated cherry blossoms was beautiful. the only super illogical thing that bothered me was that nobody flinched at the nightclub, eventually they did but after a whole 10 minute beatdown through the whole club, but then again it's a shady nightclub for high table people. if you liked the first three movies, get your ass to the cinema. yeah.","30 march 2023","2/10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"john wick: chapter 4 (2023)","ridiculous, boring and pathetic...","drjgardner","stuntman turned writer/director chad stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit john wick. it was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary keanu reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. since then it's become the action juggernaut franchise. now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.one of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as john wick's true emotions . the rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like fishburne to compliment the magnificent reeves. rip lance reddick. it's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any i've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. just when you thought you've seen it all, stahelski/reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. these guys were born to make action movies together.the extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. the sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. the sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. it's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the wick genre.overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . but also this rich unique story may only build wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.","29 march 2023","2/10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

to the catton family home saltburn for the summer holidays oliver is thrust into the dark heart of the blue bloods nothing is as it seems though as the idyllic vacation transforms into one from hell itselfwritten and directed by emerald fennell saltburn is an initially intriguing though ultimately irritatingly derivative predictable psychological comichorror fennells narrative begins with promise in the first act you arent sure who to trust nor where the story is heading however after the action moves to the manor house saltburn things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films be they the talented mr ripley teorema or the servantthose films examined themes such as class difference obsessiveness personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes never going into them with depth nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions one in particular acts in a violent vacuum of selfobsession and jealously but why what made this character the way they are fennel never bothers to tell us seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the darkmoreover her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches oliver is essentially just a less charismatic scouse tom ripley with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness felix is exactly like ripleys object of obsession dickie greenleaf while his eccentric family are people weve seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy the ruling class among them familiar and lacking in depth fennells characters arent particularly interesting nor is her narrative particularly original further while her dialogue is frequently funny it can also be pretentious particularly during olivers intermittent narrationthroughout the film fennell handles the material with great deference too much one might argue she lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power the ending featuring fullfrontal nudity reminiscent of the music video to liam gallaghers once starring a thankfully clothed eric cantona seems selfindulgent and shall we say cocky furthermore a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy so completely does it abandon realworld logicconversely linus sandgrens glossy cinematography is striking sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles heightening the suspense of the narrative as well as compounding the decadence of the catton family he employs a ratio of  giving the film a topheavy boxedin look making locations feel daunting it is work full of contrast although a cynical critic might suggest an overreliance on cliched visual metaphors such as reflections or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wingshowever sandgrens visuals generally come as a boon to proceedings as does suzie davies rich production design textured and detailed her work fosters a vivid immersive atmosphere which sophie canales costume design and charlotte dirickxs set decoration compounds in addition anthony williss score is stirring his original pieces are seedy and evocative while songs used throughout perhaps most notably sophie ellisbextors murder on the dancefloor complement the narrativebarry keoghan stars as oliver alongside jacob elordi as felix alison oliver as felixs sister venetia and rosamund pike as felixs mother elspeth keoghan is a fascinating actor who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence here however he gives an inconsistent performance when playing oliver as a weird insular personality he shines though when he has to display his dominant side keoghan lacks conviction and doesnt convince an oddly played oddly written nighttime scene with venetia being clearest evidence of thiselordi does much more assured work despite the fact that the character is just a  version of the aforementioned greenleaf he impresses though overcoming the scant characterisation of the role oliver is excellent underplaying the complexities of her character while pike steals the show as the eccentric elspeth richard e grant also stars as felixs father but is criminally underutilised while archie madekwes grating performance as felixs cousin is smug and onenotein conclusion emerald fennells saltburn is a film trying to provoke though isnt as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is though it is funny from time to time and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful the film is ultimately an uneven predictable and derivative affair while the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric the performance of star barry keoghan is inconsistent although rosamund pike is a delight the film around her is not worthy of her talents nor can she save it completely not to rub

in the first act you arent sure who to trust nor where the story is heading however after the action moves to the manor house saltburn things devolve into a messy and obvious retread of ideas that have been expressed more eloquently in previous films be they the talented mr ripley teorema or the servantthose films examined themes such as class difference obsessiveness personality and manipulation with aplomb and ingenuity fennell appears content to skirt around the edges of these themes never going into them with depth nor are the characters in her narrative provided with any kind of motivation for their actions one in particular acts in a violent vacuum of selfobsession and jealously but why what made this character the way they are fennel never bothers to tell us seeming satisfied to leave audiences in the darkmoreover her characterization is largely based on stereotypes and cliches oliver is essentially just a less charismatic scouse tom ripley with darkness beneath a thin veneer of awkward shyness felix is exactly like ripleys object of obsession dickie greenleaf while his eccentric family are people weve seen before in countless films which mock the aristocracy the ruling class among them familiar and lacking in depth fennells characters arent particularly interesting nor is her narrative particularly original further while her dialogue is frequently funny it can also be pretentious particularly during olivers intermittent narrationthroughout the film fennell handles the material with great deference too much one might argue she lets uncomfortable scenes linger interminably seeming to think this imbues them with some kind of raw power the ending featuring fullfrontal nudity reminiscent of the music video to liam gallaghers once starring a thankfully clothed eric cantona seems selfindulgent and shall we say cocky furthermore a twist in the last act is neither surprising nor effective while also sending the film into the realm of fantasy so completely does it abandon realworld logicconversely linus sandgrens glossy cinematography is striking sandgren makes excellent use of colours and unconventional shots and angles heightening the suspense of the narrative as well as compounding the decadence of the catton family he employs a ratio of  giving the film a topheavy boxedin look making locations feel daunting it is work full of contrast although a cynical critic might suggest an overreliance on cliched visual metaphors such as reflections or the obvious juxtaposition of characters wearing devil horns and angel wingshowever

design and charlotte dirickxs set decoration compounds in addition anthony williss score is stirring his original pieces are seedy and evocative while songs used throughout perhaps most notably sophie ellisbextors murder on the dancefloor complement the narrativebarry keoghan stars as oliver alongside jacob elordi as felix alison oliver as felixs sister venetia and rosamund pike as felixs mother elspeth keoghan is a fascinating actor who plays strange characters with verve and intelligence here however he gives an inconsistent performance when playing oliver as a weird insular personality he shines though when he has to display his dominant side keoghan lacks conviction and doesnt convince an oddly played oddly written nighttime scene with venetia being clearest evidence of thiselordi does much more assured work despite the fact that the character is just a  version of the aforementioned greenleaf he impresses though overcoming the scant characterisation of the role oliver is excellent underplaying the complexities of her character while pike steals the show as the eccentric elspeth richard e grant also stars as felixs father but is criminally underutilised while archie madekwes grating performance as felixs cousin is smug and onenotein conclusion emerald fennells saltburn is a film trying to provoke though isnt as challenging nor original as its creator thinks it is though it is funny from time to time and the first act is intriguing and suspenseful the film is ultimately an uneven predictable and derivative affair while the cinematography is striking and the score atmospheric the performance of star barry keoghan is inconsistent although rosamund pike is a delight the film around her is not worthy of her talents nor can she save it completely not to rub

NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"killers of the flower moon (2023)","not the magnificent masterpiece i was hoping for not by far","imseeg","killers of the flower moon is a western crime drama film cowritten and directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor

directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue

directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those

runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of

swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the

directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those

the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of

luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it

directed by martin scorsese based on the nonfiction book of the same name by david grann starring leonardo dicaprio robert de niro and lily gladstone it touches upon an often overlooked piece of american history in the best way possible thanks to the talents of its director and castin the early s the discovery of oil on land belonging to the native american osage nation turns the tribe into some of the richest people in the world this sudden acquisition of wealth attracts the attention of white businessmen looking to seize the opportunity at stealing as much from the osage tribe as possible among this group of interlopers is ernest burkhart leonardo dicaprio whom upon arriving in oklahoma is encouraged by his uncle william king hale robert de niro to marry a member of the osage as a way of inheriting their fortune ernest soon falls in love with and later marries mollie lily gladstone a young osage woman who has strong ties to her familys riches as the white occupation of native land continues members of the osage tribe are repeatedly found murdered under mysterious circumstances with some of mollies close family being among the most prominent victimsone of my favourite things about movies is that in addition to being an enjoyable means of entertainment they also function as a great method of preservation no matter obscure the topic may be if a film is made about it and released into the mainstream then it has already been permanently preserved in some way this is especially effective if the filmmaker believes that people should be made aware of something that may otherwise have been forgotten with time and in doing so has helped maintain its relevance with the general public one event that is often glanced over is the osage indian murders a series of slayings of wealthy members of the native american osage tribe during the early th century however thanks to martin scorseses film killers of the flower moon audiences now have the chance to be both educated and entertained about this overlooked historical occurrence in a movie that provides a sophisticated eyeopening look at americas treatment of one particular group of their indigenous populationmuch like most of scorseses best known work the film is framed as an epic indepth study of the dark side of human nature we watch how the osage tribe who live in harmony among themselves are forcibly thrust into the sights of the outside world after oil is found on their land in spite of the vast wealth they have all accumulated the osage are unable to hold back against the large tide of white people showing up and attempting to steal away everything that is rightly theirs because of this the tribes happy existence has been compromised as they are subjected to frequent discrimination first verbal and then physical it is here we see the sinister plan of william king hale come into play where he marries off his nephew ernest into the osage as a way of pilfering their riches when the time is right what makes this scheme so intriguing to watch is not only the patience required to pull it off but the ethical ramifications that result from it only a filmmaker like scorsese could explore a topic like this with such complexity and in a style that remains as timeless as everadditionally almost all of scorseses visual trademarks as a director are on full display here from his wideopen cinematography designed to immerse the audience in the world of s america to his creative framing of characters in shot to give a certain perspective on a scene one in particular that stood out to me was during a conversation between ernest and william as they discuss business regarding the osage we see the two seated inside a darkly lit room discussing what type of future lies ahead for the entire tribe with ernest choosing to remain loyal to his osage wife mollie while his uncle william reminds his nephew of the important reason why he married her in the first place here scorsese places the characters in a way that makes them look out of place inside a single bright spot in the dark room the darkness surrounding these two can be likened to a perfect visual representation of their true intentions and the supposed brightness focused on them is in actuality a metaphor for their tainted presence on everything the osage have created up until this pointdue to the scale of its theme and plotting the film rightfully earns its long runtime of almost three and a half hours  minutes in total this is because there are so many different facets to explore with each of the characters as their actions and the resulting consequences make for a compelling viewing experience while i personally think this made the film more interesting to watch im not entirely sure the same can be said for casual viewers the films pacing is intentionally slow as a means to build tension in the air which i believe works rather effectively and the minimal musical score is used as a method to showcase a more realistic point of view during scenes of raw emotion in other words this is a film that requires patience and an attentive mind something of which is greatly rewarded to anybody who manages to display both of these virtues to that effect scorsese has made a film that is heavily reliant on atmosphere rather than the frequent action of most other hollywood blockbustersin his sixth collaboration with the legendary director leonardo dicaprio delivers yet another memorable performance in the role of ernest burkhart what makes dicaprios character so intriguing is his indecisive nature in that he is torn between supporting his own white family or his osage wife mollie on one hand ernests loyalty towards his birth family is what made him go ahead with his uncles idea in the first place while on the other hand when he truly falls for mollie he cannot bring himself to end her along with her entire tribe dicaprio displays his signature range of emotion here alternating between a strong family man and a submissive weakling doing his uncles bidding both of which he pulls off quite effectivelyafter working on ten films together robert de niro steps back from his usual spot as the scorsese lead and into the supporting role as william king hale where he is essentially the main antagonist of this story hale is a man who is determined to weasel his way into wealth regardless of whether or not he has truly earned it his intentions are malicious and are only meant to serve his own personal gain with little regard for the wellbeing of others even his nephew what i consider to be his worst character trait is that he believes all of his actions are justified by what the bible says about spreading the word of god his claim that god wants him to participate in the genocide of an entire race of people is nothing short of evil and he demonstrates this at numerous points throughout the film a role like this is perfect for an actor like robert de niro and what better director to show this to the world than martin scorsesehowever the films true standout would have to be lily gladstone as mollie who is truly the heart and soul of this story here is a woman who has experienced so much pain and heartbreak in her life whether its her own physical ailments or the sudden death of her relatives yet despite all these hardships mollie remains as steadfast as ever choosing to be a loving wife to her husband and caring mother to her young children mollie essentially represents all of the positive values that her tribe upholds and she is among the last of her family who hasnt completely sold herself out to the ideals of a rich lifestyle this is easily a career defining role for gladstone and she certainly has potential to be noteworthy star one dayfor the american history buff and the martin scorsese fan killers of the flower moon represents a fascinating look into the best of both worlds it brings attention to an often neglected historical issue through use of another wellcrafted cinematic addition to a beloved filmmaking veterans library as mentioned previously it is nice to know that this story has now been effectively preserved through the medium of film which means that future generations will be able to watch it back and learn about the horrific events that took place during this time period after all as the classic saying goes  those

the duration of both those pictures is necessary one could argue to tell their stories without sacrificing details coherence or excitement then there are films like heavens gate which also has a runtime of over three hours and is a bloated selfindulgent and unaffecting watch thanks to director michael ciminos arrogant refusal to cut anythingmartin scorseses killers of the flower moon teeters somewhere between both camps it has elements deserving of high praise but is inarguably too long with pacing structural and narrative issues galore based on the nonfiction novel of the same name by david grann the film centers on emmet burkhart a simpleminded world war i veteran who returns to the osage nation to the home of his uncle william king hale there emmet falls for an osage named mollie who his uncle tells him is set to inherit much of her peoples oil headrights meanwhile someone is killing off the wealthy osage in the area and it looks like mollies family might be nexton paper it sounds like a fascinating exciting picture with dashes of psychological intrigue however scorseses version of the tale is dour swollen and predictable granns riveting story is transformed into a formulaic meditation on moral corruption and greed lacking any kind of suspense or momentum screenwriters scorsese and eric roth cram too much into the narrative namely too many characters and unnecessary scenes leading to redundant dialogue and vice versa they have to scrabble to end proceedings neatly which they dont do preferring to hastily sum up events rather than let them play outhad scorsese and longtime collaborator thelma schoonmaker been more active in the editing booth things could have been different there are some brilliant sequences in the movie in fact the first third is engaging and intriguing the mystery is successfully set up the location established and the characters introduced then things start going downhill the pacing slows to a crawl for the remainder of the runtime until the end of course when it rushes to its sloppy conclusion beyond pacing there are some fundamental flaws editingwise that are inexplicable considering scorsese and schoonmakers prestigefor example seemingly important characters are introduced then disappear for long stretches of time similarly the fate of some characters is either driven home multiple times or overlooked leaving us in the dark furthermore at times cuts occur just as someone is opening their mouth to speak all this including the fact that the runtime could have easily been trimmed by forty minutes without negatively affecting the narrative is amateur work far below scorsese and schoonmakers levelthis is not to say however that killers of the flower moon is without redeeming elements to make a film about cultural appropriation is always a just cause worthy of commendation no matter its effectiveness scorsese should also be applauded for trying something new although he fails to deliver a compelling or insightful story about the exploitation of the osage people the film doesnt explore the historical or cultural context of the osage nation nor the psychological and emotional impact of the murders on the survivorsscorsese and roths narrative also fails to challenge the stereotypes and prejudices that the white characters have towards the osage or the systemic injustice that they face their characterisation lacks depth or nuance relying on familiar tropes and cliched attitudes had he focused on the perspective and agency of the osage rather than the corrupt inept white characters scorsese could have had a masterpiece on his handsconversely rodrigo prietos cinematography is evocative and enchanting it makes for a stunning watch proving scorseses eye for visuals has not been blinded under scorseses direction prieto captures the beauty and brutality of the oklahoma landscape astutely while jack fisks detailed production design lends proceedings authenticity and textural richness which adam williss set decoration and jacqueline wests costume design only compoundsmoreover the late great robbie robertsons score is striking bearing a resemblance to the work of ry cooder full of sleazy slide guitars and indian chants it complements the narrative perfectly the inclusion of periodaccurate songs also lends the movie a dose of realism which in the times of baz luhrmann who insists on bizarrely using modern music in period pieces is most welcome the last project robertson worked on before his death his contribution to the picture acts as a powerful swansongleonardo dicaprio stars as emmet alongside lily gladstone as mollie and robert deniro as king hale dicaprio has the ability to turn in brilliant performances but here takes a page out of the daniel day lewis playbook the most intense acting must surely be the best dicaprio spends the whole film frowning scrunching his mouth up and completely overdoing his characters expressions and eccentricities in the first third he has a bit of range though for the latter two thirds gives a tonally one note performanceas does lily gladstone initially she creates in mollie a nuanced and witty character who can see through people she doesnt suffer fools and we find her both compelling and captivating however after the first third of the film she becomes subservient unquestioning and dull and all this before there are medicinal reasons for her being shall we say slowed down deniro for his part plays king hale like an evil george burns manipulative darkly funny and morally bereft anytime hes on screen the film is a joy hes the best thing about itthey are supported by a large cast of talented actors some of whom do great work ty mitchell is excellent as john a poor man drawn into emmet and king hales plans who has more dignity then the both of them combined jesse plemons does typically fine work as fbi man tom white while louis cancelmi is seedily slick as kelsie morrison a stooge of king hales on the other hand the likes of cara jade myers as mollies alcoholic sister and brendan fraser in a thankfully small role as king hales lawyer are both so miscast and over the top they distract from everything going on around themits a sad indictment of a film when its central message was summed up more succinctly in a dean martin song the money song from  them that have it get more of it the less they need it the more they love it such is the thesis of the film greed spreads like a plague and the richer you are the greedier you are its not original nor is it profound

vengeance trilogy  sympathy for mr vengeance boksuneun naui geot  oldboy oldeuboi  and lady vengeance chinjeolhan geumjassi   brought southkorean cinema to western awareness and made park an acclaimed auteur of world cinema the trademarks of parks films which have sometimes seemed to become equivalent with the reputation of southkorean cinema in general are shocking violence the eccentric portrayal of love and complex narratives that employ surprising twists the latest film from the director probably will not disappoint the dedicated global audience of such films but decision to leave heojil kyolshim  is also something much morehaejun park haeil is a married police officer who suffers from insomnia as he keeps driving between two cities on misty roads his work is in busan but his wife played by jung yiseo awaits him in ipo when a businessman dies in what seems to be a mountain climbing accident the police immediately pick up the businessmans chinese wife seorae tang wei as a primary suspect the case seems clear to most but haejuns feelings for seorae cloud his vision and judgment in typical park fashion the situation quickly turns more complicated haejuns feelings become obsessive and soon there seems to be no way out from the mist of emotionsthere is a touch of masumuras a wife confesses  and obviously hitchcocks vertigo  in the films premise but park has stated that decision to leave was in fact inspired by a korean love song angae or mist sung by jung hoon hee in the s in the song someone who has lost their lover in the past gets lost in the fog we speak of
