"1","The Sandman","Supermanfan-13","18 July 2023","8/10","I have to say I enjoyed The Sandman more than I thought I would. I have to admit I knew nothing of the comic or even heard of it so I had no expectations at all. It is definitely something different and unlike any show I've seen. The closest thing is American Gods but I stoped watching that in Season 2 as the quality of that show fell off after the first season. It has a solid 7.9 so it looks like most people seem to like it. I thought Tom Sturridge did an excellent job as the lead and Boyd Holbrook was just as good as one of the villains the of the story. The creator of the comic book (Neil Gaiman) is an executive producer so hopefully he'll have a big say as to where the story goes. It's already been renewed so I'm looking forward to more of the story.","It's Worth Watching"
"2","The Sandman","DiCaprioFan1","12 December 2023","8/10","Having never read the books I wasn't really sure what to expect from The Sandman. Then after reading through the reviews and seeing how mixed they were I was even more confused about whether I should give it a try. I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it. I just read that it got renewed for a second season so that's good news. It looks like most of the negative reviews are from people that are mad that it's not exactly like the source material and I've never got that. As long as it's entertaining...who cares. Movies and shows have to be adapted for tv and are just based off the source material. Less than 5% of the people who watch these movies and tv shows have actually read the book or comic it's based on.","Decent Enough"
"3","The Sandman","william-eugensson","31 August 2022","6/10","I thought the show was really great the first episodes, dark setting and interesting characters. Somewhere along the way I grew bored by the show however. I will probably watch the second season if it ever comes out since I am a fan of the novels. This was entertaining but the stark difference to how it started and how it ended made it less interesting for me. I hope the next season will focus on what made the first episodes so good. I think maybe sandmand will have a hard time to compete with all the upcoming franchises coming out this fall, I hope I am wrong though!On another note, 600 characters requirement for a short user review is too damn long!","Great start but the show loses it's initial momentum"
"4","The Sandman","fraser-simons","7 August 2022","8/10","So far, it follows the comic books quite faithfully. The first half sees him imprisoned and searching out his tools, then it transitions to being about humanity and his relationship to it.Now, I think the first half is a 10/10. It is perfection. Incredibly to see that section rendered so well, and it made me immediately want to re read the comics.The second half is more like a 7/10, so I rounded it to around 8, because I think though it captures to the plot beats quite well in its remix for television, it also fails to capture the uncanny aesthetic from the comics. This makes it feel incongruent with the first half and too mundane at times. The atmosphere feels at odds with what is cultivated in the first half.Story wise, I have to disagree with many others. I think the transition and exploration is a smart move for the story overall, because it's just not sustainable to have the first arc throughout and it makes sense for where his character is at to explore what humanity means to him and who he is, which is shirked at the start for the awesome quest. It requires a downbeat and the ideas explored are still top notch. I maintain the only flaw is that the way they bring the arc to tv, aesthetically, feels like a miss. Also, some of the actors aren't as good in the later half - such as Rose, who feels only passable.That said, totally stoked for more of this. Absolutely.","A series of two halves"
"5","The Sandman","tinytots2","10 November 2022","6/10","An adaptation of Neil Gaiman's comic series by the same name, The Sandman features the enigmatic Lord of Dreams as he governs his kingdom (""the Dreaming"") in the face of selfish mortal machinations and diabolical familial schemes. Presented largely in the form of episodic adventures, the first season consists of two distinct plotlines. The first pertains to Dream's search for his tools after his release from a century of human captivity while the second revolves around Rose Walker, the dream Vortex whose existence and powers are a source of peril to both the real world and the Dreaming.It must be said that the premise of The Sandman is a thrilling one. Thanks largely to its wonderful source material, the story presents its mythological and fantastical elements in a gripping manner while also retaining human emotions to render it meaningful and relatable. The rich visuals in the form of the varied vivid settings (like the unsettling ""cereal"" convention) and colourful character designs (of which the Corinthian is a stand-out) are impressive, immersing one into an entrancing new world to explore and discover. And the short anecdotes are an especial delight, be it the timeless tale of Hob Gandling, Dream's illuminating conversation with his sister Death, or the binding and release of the muse Calliope.Unfortunately, the second half of the show does not live up to the promise of the first. The whole Vortex subplot feels a muddled mess with too much exposition and little reason given for the audience to care about the introduced characters. There are other general grievances, most notable of which is the naivete and powerlessness with which Dream is portrayed, aspects that do not fit one of The Endless. To state further personal criticisms: the score is lacklustre, the acting quality is variable, the casting choices feel at times forced, and the dialogue tends in places to have an overly British tone.Nevertheless, as a fantasy buff, I have hope and anticipation for the next season. Not having read the comic books myself, I have no specific expectations or preconceptions but look forward to another dream-filled escapade, even if it's a nightmare-dominated one. Care to join along on the wild ride?","A journey amongst dreams that flounders after an intriguing start"
"6","The Sandman","grinningelvis","3 September 2022","6/10","If Sandman were doing it's job, episodes 7-10 would explain why we should care about Dream and The Dreaming, not alienate and confuse viewers that do not have an insight into where the epic Sandman storyline eventually ends up. There is little connective tissue from Point A to Point Z, mostly because these episodes lack any real tone or nuance. The show gets busy - strangely more compacted- than even the 24 page comics they are adapted from. These episodes - without the gravity of a gifted actor like David Thewlis - just sort of spiral into nonsense. And since little effort is placed on delineating the importance or role of Dream or The Dreaming (or for that matter, the identities of The Endless as characters or the function of their realms) the series comes off as dull and drab and dim-witted.""the Sandman"" is one if the most emotional, insightful, intelligent comics ever written, and it accomplishes so much by suggesting the fantastical in the mundane. But in this Netflix adaptation, The Dreaming and Reality have no clear identities - just noisy cross-cutting between often drab actors performing rote functions. That's why, perhaps, the performance of Thewlis pops so much. We need to see the consequences of an innocent character interacting with the ideas of a universe so beyond his control. Every bit of momentum that the show builds up in those center episodes puts a greater emphasis on how the first episode and especially episodes 7-10 utterly fail.Netflix's Sandman lacks scope, and ultimately comes off as pretty silly when it fails to maintain a solid core of genuine human emotion. Why, for example, squander the casting of Stephen Fry and the warm, wonderful Gilbert character with such a slim, unconvincing treatment? Gilbert's journey is essential as a mirror to that of the Corinthian, and all of the queasy menace of a ""cereal convention"" gets lost in the production's dayglo attitudes, loose ends, and loud box-checking.I turned on this series the second Rose, Unity, and Jed began stumbling through these awful scripts and questionable performances. Any honest crew could have seen that mess going wrong. How could they not, having obviously understood the significance of, say, ""Passengers"" and ""The Sound of Her Wings""? If Jed, Unity, and Rose are a ""family"", hiw are supposed to believe that Dream has any real affection for Death or Hob, or even compassion for John Dee or Johanna Constantine? The emotional gravity devolves into nonsensical B-movie execution.If Sandman gets a second season, it will have to address the elephant in the room - casting and scope will have to get much more expansive and solve a lot of scale problems. Nothing here suggests that this can be accomplished. If you read through the negative responses to the series, you can see that folks don't have a lot of patience for the massive world-building that makes the conclusion of Sandman so moving and philosophically relevant. But as a fan of the source material, one has to ask why a die-hard would want to see such messy adaptations of works that deserve better?With the two most awkward Sandman texts out of the way, the meat of the series comes next, but nothing in episodes 7-10 suggest that these producers are up to the task.","Uneven, clumsy, and lacking scope."
"7","The Sandman","dreadlk","16 August 2022","5/10","The show started out pretty good and hit a really big peak with Episode 6, which was a master piece of dialog and acting. Then it just felt like the director or someone else was fired because after episode 6 it was a struggle to watch it until the end.I would like to see more of seasons of the show but they have to fix the pacing and limit the amount of odd characters. I think that was really the problem after episode 6. It started to introduce all of these weird human characters and then directed the normal characters to act as though nothing was wrong with them. It was all a bit odd as any sane person would never go near people like this, yet it was all accepted with a smile and a chuckle and endless fruitless dialog.","I agree, it nosed dived after Episode 6"
"8","The Sandman","W011y4m5","5 August 2022","8/10","It's fair to say I've always been somewhat of a fan of the distinctively whimsical, quintessential eccentricity imbued within famous author Neil Gaiman's writing (ever since - in 2011 - first being introduced to it as a child in BBC1's 6th season of ""Doctor Who"", with his critically acclaimed episode ""The Doctor's Wife"") & therefore, as a long-time admirer of his impressive portfolio of work, growing up alongside his growing number of flourishing projects, I'd previously made consistent efforts to acquaint myself with his prior TV adaptations ""Good Omens"" & ""American Gods"" but admittedly, had never yet had the pleasure of reading the much beloved ""Sandman"" graphic novels (of which this series is based upon, widely considered to be his best) before. Hence, I personally went in to this season with no preconceived expectations & thus, I must concede - after viewing the first 3 installments - that this Netflix series has completely blown me away & ironically surpassed even my wildest dreams.Of course, I can only comment as a casual viewer (& am unable to ascertain the faithfulness to the source material, present within these episodes), but within the first 3 hours, we as an audience are introduced to a rich, layered, enchanting world of pure imagination that is creatively borne, masterfully realised & the sheer scope & scale captured from beginning to end is honestly mesmerising. Indeed, it's no surprise to witness peculiar & cerebral fantastical wonders on screen - in a fantasy constructed from the inspired mind of such a quirky, ingenious scribe - yet nonetheless, I still found myself utterly confounded by the sheer regality & majesty of this grandiose, unconventional & wholly epic tale.It's a credit to all of the cast & crew members involved, who've respectfully & lovingly brought such a breathtaking universe to life & I'm hopeful the quality established here in the preliminary chapters will continue throughout... Because from what I've seen, I'm seriously floored. It is utterly remarkable, beautifully dark & haunted & unlike anything I've had the opportunity to previously binge on the streaming service, in its history.There's a palpable sense of history & mythology to it which immediately draws you in & I cannot wait to see more. What a major achievement!","Spellbinding & visionary."
"9","The Sandman","Starbuck-13","5 August 2022","8/10","Three episodes in, I'm kinda glad there's enough about this show that I like.As a fan of the comic books, I have to say that I was not actually looking forward to this as there's so much you can do wrong with such an outstanding source material. But the show is close enough to the comics, visually beautiful and most important, more captivating than most other shows today - you want to keep on watching!Sadly the emphasis on the Corinthian as an evil mastermind seems unnecessary to me, and it's really sad that an essential element of the first Sandman issue - Morpheus sentencing his captor Alex Burgess to 'eternal awakening' - is totally left out. This would have shown how ruthless an Endless will be if treated badly, definitely a missed opportunity. Look it up in the comics, it's that good!!! Also the timeline seems shaky considering Dream was captured for over 100 years now (about 70 in the comics) making Alex and Paul what? 120 years old when he escapes? Also John Dee would be nearly a hundred?Well about the politics I can live with that but I do understand it's hard for many people to swallow race and/or gender swapping for more than half a dozen characters - while the bad guys all remain white men... It's sad that there will be so much controversy about this that the show could suffer from it.Oh by the way I love Tom Sturridges performance so far! His German dubbing actor is terrible so I watch the English original, Sturridges voice is close to what I always imagined reading the comics.","Entertaining but not up to the comic books perfection"
"10","The Sandman","crazelord","6 August 2022","8/10","This was quite an enjoyable watch, doing a great job at adapting the comic series into a show for modern audiences. The setting and plot are compelling, the set design and art direction are great, and I think they did an excellent job in casting Dream (Morpheus). It's also well written with good dialogue.It does miss a darkness of the comic though. Everything is less creepy and dream feels nerfed. Comic books have no limitations to what can be portrayed at any time, making the supernatural characters and elements constantly shifting and reacting to the world.But the show, like most comic adaptations, have to deal with actual human being, budgets, time constraints, technology, etc. So a lot of what made the visuals in the comic and set the mood and showing the power of the characters has to be dropped.And that's just something I tend to dislike about any adaptation of a supernatural or superhero series. And why I generally prefer an animated series instead of love action. But this is what we got and I like it.What does surprise me though is the pacing at times. It can be surprisingly slow and boring at moments, which you'd think that be avoided being a 10 episode season they could have moved it along and adapted more issues if there was too much space. But then the latter half becomes way too fast paced and convoluted with a lot happening off screen.The show is at its best when it focuses more on character stories. Episodes 5&6 are excellent examples of that being some of the best tv I've seen all year.Overa I think it's a good watch for new comers and fans of the comic.----But one thing that isn't an issue and it's pathetic that there are actually so many reviews complaining about this is having non white or male actors for roles that were white and male in the comic. They're acting like this is some agenda. When really it's just casting who they thought fit the part, and surprise surprise, some actors aren't white or male! Who knew....For most of these characters their race or gender isn't even a factor in their characterization, it really should not matter to you what they look like (like Lucienne). You can make that argument for John Constantine being male is a part of his character generallt but in the Sandman story that wasn't really a part of it.For the sake of the show being its own contained universe it's a moot point and Jenna Coleman is great at the role. You can rationalize it all you like, but unless them being white or male is inherint to their character (and we're dealing mostly with supernatural beings that don't care about race or gender) then getting butthurt about it is indicative of beliefs you may want to work on.And don't get me started on all the people complaining about the LGBTQ aspects. You must not have read the comics if you think this is forced in. But also how pathetic do you have to be for getting so butthurt that gay people exist?","Good but still limited by it being a show (no, I don't care that Constantine is a girl now)."

It looks like most of the negative reviews are from people that are mad that it's not exactly like the source material and I've never got that. As long as it's entertaining...who cares.

"24","The Sandman","fraser-simons","7 August 2022","8/10","So far, it follows the comic books quite faithfully. The first half sees him imprisoned and searching out his tools, then it transitions to being about humanity and his relationship to it.Now, I think the first half is a 10/10. It is perfection. Incredibly to see that section rendered so well, and it made me immediately want to re read the comics.The second half is more like a 7/10, so I rounded it to around 8, because I think though it captures to the plot beats quite well in its remix for television, it also fails to capture the uncanny aesthetic from the comics. This makes it feel incongruent with the first half and too mundane at times. The atmosphere feels at odds with what is cultivated in the first half.Story wise, I have to disagree with many others. I think the transition and exploration is a smart move for the story overall, because it's just not sustainable to have the first arc throughout and it makes sense for where his character is at to explore what humanity means to him and who he is, which is shirked at the start for the awesome quest. It requires a downbeat and the ideas explored are still top notch. I maintain the only flaw is that the way they bring the arc to tv, aesthetically, feels like a miss.

"25","The Sandman","tinytots2","10 November 2022","6/10","An adaptation of Neil Gaiman's comic series by the same name, The Sandman features the enigmatic Lord of Dreams as he governs his kingdom (""the Dreaming"") in the face of selfish mortal machinations and diabolical familial schemes. Presented largely in the form of episodic adventures, the first season consists of two distinct plotlines. The first pertains to Dream's search for his tools after his release from a century of human captivity while the second revolves around Rose Walker, the dream Vortex whose existence and powers are a source of peril to both the real world and the Dreaming.It must be said that the premise of The Sandman is a thrilling one. Thanks largely to its wonderful source material, the story presents its mythological and fantastical elements in a gripping manner while also retaining human emotions to render it meaningful and relatable. The rich visuals in the form of the varied vivid settings (like the unsettling ""cereal"" convention) and colourful character designs (of which the Corinthian is a stand-out) are impressive, immersing one into an entrancing new world to explore and discover. And the short anecdotes are an especial delight, be it the timeless tale of Hob Gandling, Dream's illuminating conversation with his sister Death, or the binding and release of the muse Calliope.Unfortunately, the second half of the show does not live up to the promise of the first. The whole Vortex subplot feels a muddled mess with too much exposition and little reason given for the audience to care about the introduced characters. There are other general grievances, most notable of which is the naivete and powerlessness with which Dream is portrayed, aspects that do not fit one of The Endless. To state further personal criticisms: the score is lacklustre, the acting quality is variable, the casting choices feel at times forced, and the dialogue tends in places to have an overly British tone.Nevertheless, as a fantasy buff, I have hope and anticipation for the next season. Not having read the comic books myself, I have no specific expectations or preconceptions but look forward to another dream-filled escapade, even if it's a nightmare-dominated one.

"26","The Sandman","grinningelvis","3 September 2022","6/10","If Sandman were doing it's job, episodes 7-10 would explain why we should care about Dream and The Dreaming, not alienate and confuse viewers that do not have an insight into where the epic Sandman storyline eventually ends up. There is little connective tissue from Point A to Point Z, mostly because these episodes lack any real tone or nuance. The show gets busy - strangely more compacted- than even the 24 page comics they are adapted from. These episodes - without the gravity of a gifted actor like David Thewlis - just sort of spiral into nonsense. And since little effort is placed on delineating the importance or role of Dream or The Dreaming (or for that matter, the identities of The Endless as characters or the function of their realms) the series comes off as dull and drab and dim-witted.""the Sandman"" is one if the most emotional, insightful, intelligent comics ever written, and it accomplishes so much by suggesting the fantastical in the mundane. But in this Netflix adaptation, The Dreaming and Reality have no clear identities - just noisy cross-cutting between often drab actors performing rote functions. That's why, perhaps, the performance of Thewlis pops so much. We need to see the consequences of an innocent character interacting with the ideas of a universe so beyond his control. Every bit of momentum that the show builds up in those center episodes puts a greater emphasis on how the first episode and especially episodes 7-10 utterly fail.Netflix's Sandman lacks scope, and ultimately comes off as pretty silly when it fails to maintain a solid core of genuine human emotion. Why, for example, squander the casting of Stephen Fry and the warm, wonderful Gilbert character with such a slim, unconvincing treatment? Gilbert's journey is essential as a mirror to that of the Corinthian, and all of the queasy menace of a ""cereal convention"" gets lost in the production's dayglo attitudes, loose ends, and loud box-checking.I turned on this series the second Rose, Unity, and Jed began stumbling through these awful scripts and questionable performances. Any honest crew could have seen that mess going wrong. How could they not, having obviously understood the significance of, say, ""Passengers"" and ""The Sound of Her Wings""? If Jed, Unity, and Rose are a ""family"", hiw are supposed to believe that Dream has any real affection for Death or Hob, or even compassion for John Dee or Johanna Constantine? The emotional gravity devolves into nonsensical B-movie execution.If Sandman gets a second season, it will have to address the elephant in the room - casting and scope will have to get much more expansive and solve a lot of scale problems. Nothing here suggests that this can be accomplished. If you read through the negative responses to the series, you can see that folks don't have a lot of patience for the massive world-building that makes the conclusion of Sandman so moving and philosophically relevant. But as a fan of the source material, one has to ask why a die-hard would want to see such messy adaptations of works that deserve better?With the two most awkward Sandman texts out of the way, the meat of the series comes next, but nothing in episodes 7-10 suggest that these producers are up to the task.","Uneven, clumsy, and lacking scope."

I think that was really the problem after episode 6. It started to introduce all of these weird human characters and then directed the normal characters to act as though nothing was wrong with them.

Hence, I personally went in to this season with no preconceived expectations & thus, I must concede - after viewing the first 3 installments - that this Netflix series has completely blown me away & ironically surpassed even my wildest dreams.Of course, I can only comment as a casual viewer (& am unable to ascertain the faithfulness to the source material, present within these episodes), but within the first 3 hours, we as an audience are introduced to a rich, layered, enchanting world of pure imagination that is creatively borne, masterfully realised & the sheer scope & scale captured from beginning to end is honestly mesmerising. Indeed, it's no surprise to witness peculiar & cerebral fantastical wonders on screen - in a fantasy constructed from the inspired mind of such a quirky, ingenious scribe - yet nonetheless, I still found myself utterly confounded by the sheer regality & majesty of this grandiose, unconventional & wholly epic tale.It's a credit to all of the cast & crew members involved, who've respectfully & lovingly brought such a breathtaking universe to life & I'm hopeful the quality established here in the preliminary chapters will continue throughout...

This would have shown how ruthless an Endless will be if treated badly, definitely a missed opportunity. Look it up in the comics, it's that good!!! Also the timeline seems shaky considering Dream was captured for over 100 years now (about 70 in the comics) making Alex and Paul what? 120 years old when he escapes? Also John Dee would be nearly a hundred?Well about the politics I can live with that but I do understand it's hard for many people to swallow race and/or gender swapping for more than half a dozen characters - while the bad guys all remain white men... It's sad that there will be so much controversy about this that the show could suffer from it.Oh by the way I love Tom Sturridges performance so far!

The setting and plot are compelling, the set design and art direction are great, and I think they did an excellent job in casting Dream (Morpheus). It's also well written with good dialogue.It does miss a darkness of the comic though. Everything is less creepy and dream feels nerfed. Comic books have no limitations to what can be portrayed at any time, making the supernatural characters and elements constantly shifting and reacting to the world.But the show, like most comic adaptations, have to deal with actual human being, budgets, time constraints, technology, etc. So a lot of what made the visuals in the comic and set the mood and showing the power of the characters has to be dropped.And that's just something I tend to dislike about any adaptation of a supernatural or superhero series. And why I generally prefer an animated series instead of love action. But this is what we got and I like it.What does surprise me though is the pacing at times. It can be surprisingly slow and boring at moments, which you'd think that be avoided being a 10 episode season they could have moved it along and adapted more issues if there was too much space. But then the latter half becomes way too fast paced and convoluted with a lot happening off screen.The show is at its best when it focuses more on character stories.

They're acting like this is some agenda. When really it's just casting who they thought fit the part, and surprise surprise, some actors aren't white or male! Who knew....For most of these characters their race or gender isn't even a factor in their characterization, it really should not matter to you what they look like (like Lucienne). You can make that argument for John Constantine being male is a part of his character generallt but in the Sandman story that wasn't really a part of it.For the sake of the show being its own contained universe it's a moot point and Jenna Coleman is great at the role.

"44","The Sandman","fraser-simons","7 August 2022","8/10","So far, it follows the comic books quite faithfully. The first half sees him imprisoned and searching out his tools, then it transitions to being about humanity and his relationship to it.Now, I think the first half is a 10/10. It is perfection. Incredibly to see that section rendered so well, and it made me immediately want to re read the comics.The second half is more like a 7/10, so I rounded it to around 8, because I think though it captures to the plot beats quite well in its remix for television, it also fails to capture the uncanny aesthetic from the comics.

It requires a downbeat and the ideas explored are still top notch. I maintain the only flaw is that the way they bring the arc to tv, aesthetically, feels like a miss.

"45","The Sandman","tinytots2","10 November 2022","6/10","An adaptation of Neil Gaiman's comic series by the same name, The Sandman features the enigmatic Lord of Dreams as he governs his kingdom (""the Dreaming"") in the face of selfish mortal machinations and diabolical familial schemes. Presented largely in the form of episodic adventures, the first season consists of two distinct plotlines. The first pertains to Dream's search for his tools after his release from a century of human captivity while the second revolves around Rose Walker, the dream Vortex whose existence and powers are a source of peril to both the real world and the Dreaming.It must be said that the premise of The Sandman is a thrilling one. Thanks largely to its wonderful source material, the story presents its mythological and fantastical elements in a gripping manner while also retaining human emotions to render it meaningful and relatable. The rich visuals in the form of the varied vivid settings (like the unsettling ""cereal"" convention) and colourful character designs (of which the Corinthian is a stand-out) are impressive, immersing one into an entrancing new world to explore and discover. And the short anecdotes are an especial delight, be it the timeless tale of Hob Gandling, Dream's illuminating conversation with his sister Death, or the binding and release of the muse Calliope.Unfortunately, the second half of the show does not live up to the promise of the first. The whole Vortex subplot feels a muddled mess with too much exposition and little reason given for the audience to care about the introduced characters. There are other general grievances, most notable of which is the naivete and powerlessness with which Dream is portrayed, aspects that do not fit one of The Endless. To state further personal criticisms: the score is lacklustre, the acting quality is variable, the casting choices feel at times forced, and the dialogue tends in places to have an overly British tone.Nevertheless, as a fantasy buff, I have hope and anticipation for the next season. Not having read the comic books myself, I have no specific expectations or preconceptions but look forward to another dream-filled escapade, even if it's a nightmare-dominated one.

There is little connective tissue from Point A to Point Z, mostly because these episodes lack any real tone or nuance. The show gets busy - strangely more compacted- than even the 24 page comics they are adapted from. These episodes - without the gravity of a gifted actor like David Thewlis - just sort of spiral into nonsense. And since little effort is placed on delineating the importance or role of Dream or The Dreaming (or for that matter, the identities of The Endless as characters or the function of their realms) the series comes off as dull and drab and dim-witted.""the Sandman"" is one if the most emotional, insightful, intelligent comics ever written, and it accomplishes so much by suggesting the fantastical in the mundane. But in this Netflix adaptation, The Dreaming and Reality have no clear identities - just noisy cross-cutting between often drab actors performing rote functions. That's why, perhaps, the performance of Thewlis pops so much. We need to see the consequences of an innocent character interacting with the ideas of a universe so beyond his control. Every bit of momentum that the show builds up in those center episodes puts a greater emphasis on how the first episode and especially episodes 7-10 utterly fail.Netflix's Sandman lacks scope, and ultimately comes off as pretty silly when it fails to maintain a solid core of genuine human emotion. Why, for example, squander the casting of Stephen Fry and the warm, wonderful Gilbert character with such a slim, unconvincing treatment? Gilbert's journey is essential as a mirror to that of the Corinthian, and all of the queasy menace of a ""cereal convention"" gets lost in the production's dayglo attitudes, loose ends, and loud box-checking.I turned on this series the second Rose, Unity, and Jed began stumbling through these awful scripts and questionable performances. Any honest crew could have seen that mess going wrong. How could they not, having obviously understood the significance of, say, ""Passengers"" and ""The Sound of Her Wings""? If Jed, Unity, and Rose are a ""family"", hiw are supposed to believe that Dream has any real affection for Death or Hob, or even compassion for John Dee or Johanna Constantine? The emotional gravity devolves into nonsensical B-movie execution.If Sandman gets a second season, it will have to address the elephant in the room - casting and scope will have to get much more expansive and solve a lot of scale problems. Nothing here suggests that this can be accomplished. If you read through the negative responses to the series, you can see that folks don't have a lot of patience for the massive world-building that makes the conclusion of Sandman so moving and philosophically relevant. But as a fan of the source material, one has to ask why a die-hard would want to see such messy adaptations of works that deserve better?With the two most awkward Sandman texts out of the way, the meat of the series comes next, but nothing in episodes 7-10 suggest that these producers are up to the task.","Uneven, clumsy, and lacking scope."

I think that was really the problem after episode 6. It started to introduce all of these weird human characters and then directed the normal characters to act as though nothing was wrong with them.

Hence, I personally went in to this season with no preconceived expectations & thus, I must concede - after viewing the first 3 installments - that this Netflix series has completely blown me away & ironically surpassed even my wildest dreams.Of course, I can only comment as a casual viewer (& am unable to ascertain the faithfulness to the source material, present within these episodes), but within the first 3 hours, we as an audience are introduced to a rich, layered, enchanting world of pure imagination that is creatively borne, masterfully realised & the sheer scope & scale captured from beginning to end is honestly mesmerising. Indeed, it's no surprise to witness peculiar & cerebral fantastical wonders on screen - in a fantasy constructed from the inspired mind of such a quirky, ingenious scribe - yet nonetheless, I still found myself utterly confounded by the sheer regality & majesty of this grandiose, unconventional & wholly epic tale.It's a credit to all of the cast & crew members involved, who've respectfully & lovingly brought such a breathtaking universe to life & I'm hopeful the quality established here in the preliminary chapters will continue throughout...

But the show is close enough to the comics, visually beautiful and most important, more captivating than most other shows today - you want to keep on watching!Sadly the emphasis on the Corinthian as an evil mastermind seems unnecessary to me, and it's really sad that an essential element of the first Sandman issue - Morpheus sentencing his captor Alex Burgess to 'eternal awakening' - is totally left out. This would have shown how ruthless an Endless will be if treated badly, definitely a missed opportunity. Look it up in the comics, it's that good!!! Also the timeline seems shaky considering Dream was captured for over 100 years now (about 70 in the comics) making Alex and Paul what? 120 years old when he escapes? Also John Dee would be nearly a hundred?Well about the politics I can live with that but I do understand it's hard for many people to swallow race and/or gender swapping for more than half a dozen characters - while the bad guys all remain white men... It's sad that there will be so much controversy about this that the show could suffer from it.Oh by the way I love Tom Sturridges performance so far!

The setting and plot are compelling, the set design and art direction are great, and I think they did an excellent job in casting Dream (Morpheus). It's also well written with good dialogue.It does miss a darkness of the comic though. Everything is less creepy and dream feels nerfed. Comic books have no limitations to what can be portrayed at any time, making the supernatural characters and elements constantly shifting and reacting to the world.But the show, like most comic adaptations, have to deal with actual human being, budgets, time constraints, technology, etc. So a lot of what made the visuals in the comic and set the mood and showing the power of the characters has to be dropped.And that's just something I tend to dislike about any adaptation of a supernatural or superhero series. And why I generally prefer an animated series instead of love action. But this is what we got and I like it.What does surprise me though is the pacing at times. It can be surprisingly slow and boring at moments, which you'd think that be avoided being a 10 episode season they could have moved it along and adapted more issues if there was too much space. But then the latter half becomes way too fast paced and convoluted with a lot happening off screen.The show is at its best when it focuses more on character stories.

They're acting like this is some agenda. When really it's just casting who they thought fit the part, and surprise surprise, some actors aren't white or male! Who knew....For most of these characters their race or gender isn't even a factor in their characterization, it really should not matter to you what they look like (like Lucienne). You can make that argument for John Constantine being male is a part of his character generallt but in the Sandman story that wasn't really a part of it.For the sake of the show being its own contained universe it's a moot point and Jenna Coleman is great at the role. You can rationalize it all you like, but unless them being white or male is inherint to their character (and we're dealing mostly with supernatural beings that don't care about race or gender) then getting butthurt about it is indicative of beliefs you may want to work on.And don't get me started on all the people complaining about the LGBTQ aspects.

"64","The Sandman","fraser-simons","7 August 2022","8/10","So far, it follows the comic books quite faithfully. The first half sees him imprisoned and searching out his tools, then it transitions to being about humanity and his relationship to it.Now, I think the first half is a 10/10. It is perfection. Incredibly to see that section rendered so well, and it made me immediately want to re read the comics.The second half is more like a 7/10, so I rounded it to around 8, because I think though it captures to the plot beats quite well in its remix for television, it also fails to capture the uncanny aesthetic from the comics. This makes it feel incongruent with the first half and too mundane at times. The atmosphere feels at odds with what is cultivated in the first half.Story wise, I have to disagree with many others.

It requires a downbeat and the ideas explored are still top notch. I maintain the only flaw is that the way they bring the arc to tv, aesthetically, feels like a miss.

"65","The Sandman","tinytots2","10 November 2022","6/10","An adaptation of Neil Gaiman's comic series by the same name, The Sandman features the enigmatic Lord of Dreams as he governs his kingdom (""the Dreaming"") in the face of selfish mortal machinations and diabolical familial schemes. Presented largely in the form of episodic adventures, the first season consists of two distinct plotlines. The first pertains to Dream's search for his tools after his release from a century of human captivity while the second revolves around Rose Walker, the dream Vortex whose existence and powers are a source of peril to both the real world and the Dreaming.It must be said that the premise of The Sandman is a thrilling one. Thanks largely to its wonderful source material, the story presents its mythological and fantastical elements in a gripping manner while also retaining human emotions to render it meaningful and relatable. The rich visuals in the form of the varied vivid settings (like the unsettling ""cereal"" convention) and colourful character designs (of which the Corinthian is a stand-out) are impressive, immersing one into an entrancing new world to explore and discover. And the short anecdotes are an especial delight, be it the timeless tale of Hob Gandling, Dream's illuminating conversation with his sister Death, or the binding and release of the muse Calliope.Unfortunately, the second half of the show does not live up to the promise of the first. The whole Vortex subplot feels a muddled mess with too much exposition and little reason given for the audience to care about the introduced characters. There are other general grievances, most notable of which is the naivete and powerlessness with which Dream is portrayed, aspects that do not fit one of The Endless. To state further personal criticisms: the score is lacklustre, the acting quality is variable, the casting choices feel at times forced, and the dialogue tends in places to have an overly British tone.Nevertheless, as a fantasy buff, I have hope and anticipation for the next season. Not having read the comic books myself, I have no specific expectations or preconceptions but look forward to another dream-filled escapade, even if it's a nightmare-dominated one.

There is little connective tissue from Point A to Point Z, mostly because these episodes lack any real tone or nuance. The show gets busy - strangely more compacted- than even the 24 page comics they are adapted from. These episodes - without the gravity of a gifted actor like David Thewlis - just sort of spiral into nonsense. And since little effort is placed on delineating the importance or role of Dream or The Dreaming (or for that matter, the identities of The Endless as characters or the function of their realms) the series comes off as dull and drab and dim-witted.""the Sandman"" is one if the most emotional, insightful, intelligent comics ever written, and it accomplishes so much by suggesting the fantastical in the mundane. But in this Netflix adaptation, The Dreaming and Reality have no clear identities - just noisy cross-cutting between often drab actors performing rote functions. That's why, perhaps, the performance of Thewlis pops so much. We need to see the consequences of an innocent character interacting with the ideas of a universe so beyond his control. Every bit of momentum that the show builds up in those center episodes puts a greater emphasis on how the first episode and especially episodes 7-10 utterly fail.Netflix's Sandman lacks scope, and ultimately comes off as pretty silly when it fails to maintain a solid core of genuine human emotion. Why, for example, squander the casting of Stephen Fry and the warm, wonderful Gilbert character with such a slim, unconvincing treatment? Gilbert's journey is essential as a mirror to that of the Corinthian, and all of the queasy menace of a ""cereal convention"" gets lost in the production's dayglo attitudes, loose ends, and loud box-checking.I turned on this series the second Rose, Unity, and Jed began stumbling through these awful scripts and questionable performances. Any honest crew could have seen that mess going wrong. How could they not, having obviously understood the significance of, say, ""Passengers"" and ""The Sound of Her Wings""? If Jed, Unity, and Rose are a ""family"", hiw are supposed to believe that Dream has any real affection for Death or Hob, or even compassion for John Dee or Johanna Constantine? The emotional gravity devolves into nonsensical B-movie execution.If Sandman gets a second season, it will have to address the elephant in the room - casting and scope will have to get much more expansive and solve a lot of scale problems. Nothing here suggests that this can be accomplished. If you read through the negative responses to the series, you can see that folks don't have a lot of patience for the massive world-building that makes the conclusion of Sandman so moving and philosophically relevant. But as a fan of the source material, one has to ask why a die-hard would want to see such messy adaptations of works that deserve better?With the two most awkward Sandman texts out of the way, the meat of the series comes next, but nothing in episodes 7-10 suggest that these producers are up to the task.","Uneven, clumsy, and lacking scope."

I think that was really the problem after episode 6. It started to introduce all of these weird human characters and then directed the normal characters to act as though nothing was wrong with them.

Hence, I personally went in to this season with no preconceived expectations & thus, I must concede - after viewing the first 3 installments - that this Netflix series has completely blown me away & ironically surpassed even my wildest dreams.Of course, I can only comment as a casual viewer (& am unable to ascertain the faithfulness to the source material, present within these episodes), but within the first 3 hours, we as an audience are introduced to a rich, layered, enchanting world of pure imagination that is creatively borne, masterfully realised & the sheer scope & scale captured from beginning to end is honestly mesmerising. Indeed, it's no surprise to witness peculiar & cerebral fantastical wonders on screen - in a fantasy constructed from the inspired mind of such a quirky, ingenious scribe - yet nonetheless, I still found myself utterly confounded by the sheer regality & majesty of this grandiose, unconventional & wholly epic tale.It's a credit to all of the cast & crew members involved, who've respectfully & lovingly brought such a breathtaking universe to life & I'm hopeful the quality established here in the preliminary chapters will continue throughout...

But the show is close enough to the comics, visually beautiful and most important, more captivating than most other shows today - you want to keep on watching!Sadly the emphasis on the Corinthian as an evil mastermind seems unnecessary to me, and it's really sad that an essential element of the first Sandman issue - Morpheus sentencing his captor Alex Burgess to 'eternal awakening' - is totally left out. This would have shown how ruthless an Endless will be if treated badly, definitely a missed opportunity. Look it up in the comics, it's that good!!! Also the timeline seems shaky considering Dream was captured for over 100 years now (about 70 in the comics) making Alex and Paul what? 120 years old when he escapes? Also John Dee would be nearly a hundred?Well about the politics I can live with that but I do understand it's hard for many people to swallow race and/or gender swapping for more than half a dozen characters - while the bad guys all remain white men... It's sad that there will be so much controversy about this that the show could suffer from it.Oh by the way I love Tom Sturridges performance so far!

"70","The Sandman","crazelord","6 August 2022","8/10","This was quite an enjoyable watch, doing a great job at adapting the comic series into a show for modern audiences. The setting and plot are compelling, the set design and art direction are great, and I think they did an excellent job in casting Dream (Morpheus). It's also well written with good dialogue.It does miss a darkness of the comic though. Everything is less creepy and dream feels nerfed. Comic books have no limitations to what can be portrayed at any time, making the supernatural characters and elements constantly shifting and reacting to the world.But the show, like most comic adaptations, have to deal with actual human being, budgets, time constraints, technology, etc. So a lot of what made the visuals in the comic and set the mood and showing the power of the characters has to be dropped.And that's just something I tend to dislike about any adaptation of a supernatural or superhero series. And why I generally prefer an animated series instead of love action. But this is what we got and I like it.What does surprise me though is the pacing at times. It can be surprisingly slow and boring at moments, which you'd think that be avoided being a 10 episode season they could have moved it along and adapted more issues if there was too much space. But then the latter half becomes way too fast paced and convoluted with a lot happening off screen.The show is at its best when it focuses more on character stories. Episodes 5&6 are excellent examples of that being some of the best tv I've seen all year.Overa I think it's a good watch for new comers and fans of the comic.----But one thing that isn't an issue and it's pathetic that there are actually so many reviews complaining about this is having non white or male actors for roles that were white and male in the comic. They're acting like this is some agenda. When really it's just casting who they thought fit the part, and surprise surprise, some actors aren't white or male! Who knew....For most of these characters their race or gender isn't even a factor in their characterization, it really should not matter to you what they look like (like Lucienne). You can make that argument for John Constantine being male is a part of his character generallt but in the Sandman story that wasn't really a part of it.For the sake of the show being its own contained universe it's a moot point and Jenna Coleman is great at the role. You can rationalize it all you like, but unless them being white or male is inherint to their character (and we're dealing mostly with supernatural beings that don't care about race or gender) then getting butthurt about it is indicative of beliefs you may want to work on.And don't get me started on all the people complaining about the LGBTQ aspects.

"84","The Sandman","fraser-simons","7 August 2022","8/10","So far, it follows the comic books quite faithfully. The first half sees him imprisoned and searching out his tools, then it transitions to being about humanity and his relationship to it.Now, I think the first half is a 10/10. It is perfection. Incredibly to see that section rendered so well, and it made me immediately want to re read the comics.The second half is more like a 7/10, so I rounded it to around 8, because I think though it captures to the plot beats quite well in its remix for television, it also fails to capture the uncanny aesthetic from the comics. This makes it feel incongruent with the first half and too mundane at times. The atmosphere feels at odds with what is cultivated in the first half.Story wise, I have to disagree with many others. I think the transition and exploration is a smart move for the story overall, because it's just not sustainable to have the first arc throughout and it makes sense for where his character is at to explore what humanity means to him and who he is, which is shirked at the start for the awesome quest. It requires a downbeat and the ideas explored are still top notch. I maintain the only flaw is that the way they bring the arc to tv, aesthetically, feels like a miss.

"85","The Sandman","tinytots2","10 November 2022","6/10","An adaptation of Neil Gaiman's comic series by the same name, The Sandman features the enigmatic Lord of Dreams as he governs his kingdom (""the Dreaming"") in the face of selfish mortal machinations and diabolical familial schemes. Presented largely in the form of episodic adventures, the first season consists of two distinct plotlines. The first pertains to Dream's search for his tools after his release from a century of human captivity while the second revolves around Rose Walker, the dream Vortex whose existence and powers are a source of peril to both the real world and the Dreaming.It must be said that the premise of The Sandman is a thrilling one. Thanks largely to its wonderful source material, the story presents its mythological and fantastical elements in a gripping manner while also retaining human emotions to render it meaningful and relatable. The rich visuals in the form of the varied vivid settings (like the unsettling ""cereal"" convention) and colourful character designs (of which the Corinthian is a stand-out) are impressive, immersing one into an entrancing new world to explore and discover. And the short anecdotes are an especial delight, be it the timeless tale of Hob Gandling, Dream's illuminating conversation with his sister Death, or the binding and release of the muse Calliope.Unfortunately, the second half of the show does not live up to the promise of the first. The whole Vortex subplot feels a muddled mess with too much exposition and little reason given for the audience to care about the introduced characters. There are other general grievances, most notable of which is the naivete and powerlessness with which Dream is portrayed, aspects that do not fit one of The Endless. To state further personal criticisms: the score is lacklustre, the acting quality is variable, the casting choices feel at times forced, and the dialogue tends in places to have an overly British tone.Nevertheless, as a fantasy buff, I have hope and anticipation for the next season. Not having read the comic books myself, I have no specific expectations or preconceptions but look forward to another dream-filled escapade, even if it's a nightmare-dominated one.

"86","The Sandman","grinningelvis","3 September 2022","6/10","If Sandman were doing it's job, episodes 7-10 would explain why we should care about Dream and The Dreaming, not alienate and confuse viewers that do not have an insight into where the epic Sandman storyline eventually ends up. There is little connective tissue from Point A to Point Z, mostly because these episodes lack any real tone or nuance. The show gets busy - strangely more compacted- than even the 24 page comics they are adapted from. These episodes - without the gravity of a gifted actor like David Thewlis - just sort of spiral into nonsense. And since little effort is placed on delineating the importance or role of Dream or The Dreaming (or for that matter, the identities of The Endless as characters or the function of their realms) the series comes off as dull and drab and dim-witted.""the Sandman"" is one if the most emotional, insightful, intelligent comics ever written, and it accomplishes so much by suggesting the fantastical in the mundane. But in this Netflix adaptation, The Dreaming and Reality have no clear identities - just noisy cross-cutting between often drab actors performing rote functions. That's why, perhaps, the performance of Thewlis pops so much. We need to see the consequences of an innocent character interacting with the ideas of a universe so beyond his control. Every bit of momentum that the show builds up in those center episodes puts a greater emphasis on how the first episode and especially episodes 7-10 utterly fail.Netflix's Sandman lacks scope, and ultimately comes off as pretty silly when it fails to maintain a solid core of genuine human emotion. Why, for example, squander the casting of Stephen Fry and the warm, wonderful Gilbert character with such a slim, unconvincing treatment? Gilbert's journey is essential as a mirror to that of the Corinthian, and all of the queasy menace of a ""cereal convention"" gets lost in the production's dayglo attitudes, loose ends, and loud box-checking.I turned on this series the second Rose, Unity, and Jed began stumbling through these awful scripts and questionable performances. Any honest crew could have seen that mess going wrong. How could they not, having obviously understood the significance of, say, ""Passengers"" and ""The Sound of Her Wings""? If Jed, Unity, and Rose are a ""family"", hiw are supposed to believe that Dream has any real affection for Death or Hob, or even compassion for John Dee or Johanna Constantine? The emotional gravity devolves into nonsensical B-movie execution.If Sandman gets a second season, it will have to address the elephant in the room - casting and scope will have to get much more expansive and solve a lot of scale problems. Nothing here suggests that this can be accomplished. If you read through the negative responses to the series, you can see that folks don't have a lot of patience for the massive world-building that makes the conclusion of Sandman so moving and philosophically relevant. But as a fan of the source material, one has to ask why a die-hard would want to see such messy adaptations of works that deserve better?With the two most awkward Sandman texts out of the way, the meat of the series comes next, but nothing in episodes 7-10 suggest that these producers are up to the task.","Uneven, clumsy, and lacking scope."

Then it just felt like the director or someone else was fired because after episode 6 it was a struggle to watch it until the end.I would like to see more of seasons of the show but they have to fix the pacing and limit the amount of odd characters. I think that was really the problem after episode 6. It started to introduce all of these weird human characters and then directed the normal characters to act as though nothing was wrong with them. It was all a bit odd as any sane person would never go near people like this, yet it was all accepted with a smile and a chuckle and endless fruitless dialog.","I agree, it nosed dived after Episode 6"
"88","The Sandman","W011y4m5","5 August 2022","8/10","It's fair to say I've always been somewhat of a fan of the distinctively whimsical, quintessential eccentricity imbued within famous author Neil Gaiman's writing (ever since - in 2011 - first being introduced to it as a child in BBC1's 6th season of ""Doctor Who"", with his critically acclaimed episode ""The Doctor's Wife"") & therefore, as a long-time admirer of his impressive portfolio of work, growing up alongside his growing number of flourishing projects, I'd previously made consistent efforts to acquaint myself with his prior TV adaptations ""Good Omens"" & ""American Gods"" but admittedly, had never yet had the pleasure of reading the much beloved ""Sandman"" graphic novels (of which this series is based upon, widely considered to be his best) before. Hence, I personally went in to this season with no preconceived expectations & thus, I must concede - after viewing the first 3 installments - that this Netflix series has completely blown me away & ironically surpassed even my wildest dreams.Of course, I can only comment as a casual viewer (& am unable to ascertain the faithfulness to the source material, present within these episodes), but within the first 3 hours, we as an audience are introduced to a rich, layered, enchanting world of pure imagination that is creatively borne, masterfully realised & the sheer scope & scale captured from beginning to end is honestly mesmerising. Indeed, it's no surprise to witness peculiar & cerebral fantastical wonders on screen - in a fantasy constructed from the inspired mind of such a quirky, ingenious scribe - yet nonetheless, I still found myself utterly confounded by the sheer regality & majesty of this grandiose, unconventional & wholly epic tale.It's a credit to all of the cast & crew members involved, who've respectfully & lovingly brought such a breathtaking universe to life & I'm hopeful the quality established here in the preliminary chapters will continue throughout...

But the show is close enough to the comics, visually beautiful and most important, more captivating than most other shows today - you want to keep on watching!Sadly the emphasis on the Corinthian as an evil mastermind seems unnecessary to me, and it's really sad that an essential element of the first Sandman issue - Morpheus sentencing his captor Alex Burgess to 'eternal awakening' - is totally left out. This would have shown how ruthless an Endless will be if treated badly, definitely a missed opportunity. Look it up in the comics, it's that good!!! Also the timeline seems shaky considering Dream was captured for over 100 years now (about 70 in the comics) making Alex and Paul what? 120 years old when he escapes? Also John Dee would be nearly a hundred?Well about the politics I can live with that but I do understand it's hard for many people to swallow race and/or gender swapping for more than half a dozen characters - while the bad guys all remain white men... It's sad that there will be so much controversy about this that the show could suffer from it.Oh by the way I love Tom Sturridges performance so far! His German dubbing actor is terrible so I watch the English original, Sturridges voice is close to what I always imagined reading the comics.","Entertaining but not up to the comic books perfection"
"90","The Sandman","crazelord","6 August 2022","8/10","This was quite an enjoyable watch, doing a great job at adapting the comic series into a show for modern audiences. The setting and plot are compelling, the set design and art direction are great, and I think they did an excellent job in casting Dream (Morpheus). It's also well written with good dialogue.It does miss a darkness of the comic though. Everything is less creepy and dream feels nerfed. Comic books have no limitations to what can be portrayed at any time, making the supernatural characters and elements constantly shifting and reacting to the world.But the show, like most comic adaptations, have to deal with actual human being, budgets, time constraints, technology, etc. So a lot of what made the visuals in the comic and set the mood and showing the power of the characters has to be dropped.And that's just something I tend to dislike about any adaptation of a supernatural or superhero series. And why I generally prefer an animated series instead of love action. But this is what we got and I like it.What does surprise me though is the pacing at times. It can be surprisingly slow and boring at moments, which you'd think that be avoided being a 10 episode season they could have moved it along and adapted more issues if there was too much space. But then the latter half becomes way too fast paced and convoluted with a lot happening off screen.The show is at its best when it focuses more on character stories. Episodes 5&6 are excellent examples of that being some of the best tv I've seen all year.Overa I think it's a good watch for new comers and fans of the comic.----But one thing that isn't an issue and it's pathetic that there are actually so many reviews complaining about this is having non white or male actors for roles that were white and male in the comic. They're acting like this is some agenda. When really it's just casting who they thought fit the part, and surprise surprise, some actors aren't white or male! Who knew....For most of these characters their race or gender isn't even a factor in their characterization, it really should not matter to you what they look like (like Lucienne). You can make that argument for John Constantine being male is a part of his character generallt but in the Sandman story that wasn't really a part of it.For the sake of the show being its own contained universe it's a moot point and Jenna Coleman is great at the role. You can rationalize it all you like, but unless them being white or male is inherint to their character (and we're dealing mostly with supernatural beings that don't care about race or gender) then getting butthurt about it is indicative of beliefs you may want to work on.And don't get me started on all the people complaining about the LGBTQ aspects.

I have to admit I knew nothing of the comic or even heard of it so I had no expectations at all. It is definitely something different and unlike any show I've seen. The closest thing is American Gods but I stoped watching that in Season 2 as the quality of that show fell off after the first season. It has a solid 7.9 so it looks like most people seem to like it. I thought Tom Sturridge did an excellent job as the lead and Boyd Holbrook was just as good as one of the villains the of the story. The creator of the comic book (Neil Gaiman) is an executive producer so hopefully he'll have a big say as to where the story goes.
